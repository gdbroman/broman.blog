In _Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind_, author Shunryū Suzuki asks, would you rather be a bad horse, or a good horse?

_But_—he says—it does not matter what we choose. And the bad horse is also better. This is Zen.

Likewise, bad parents are the best parents. A good childhood does not equip for life.

_Parents? Horses? Where are we going?_

Here: Imperfection is our carrot.

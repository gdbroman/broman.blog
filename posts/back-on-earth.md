Every upswing. The same damn thing.

All colourful, everything possible.

Surfing on clouds, the words are clay.

Angelic awareness please would you stay?

Back on earth I have merely faith.

Now all's blue, nothing to do.

Seeking to control, I fail to rejoice.

And so it goesâ€”will there ever be choice?

An endless show in which I flow.

To and fro without plateau.

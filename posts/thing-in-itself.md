Friedrich had been having trouble with finding ground under foot lately, so in a last attempt to restore some sanity he called up an old friend for advice.

BUDDHA: _Yes, this is Buddhahood?_

NIETZSCHE: _Language, sensations, concepts—at most, these are useful metaphors._

BUDDHA: _Amazing—yes go on, please._

NIETZSCHE: _Words -_

BUDDHA: _Thank you._

NIETZSCHE: _Words—they provide relations. But to mistake language—a human product—with what is...is nothing short of anthropocentrism._

BUDDHA: Yes.

NIETZSCHE: _Concepts arise from the equation of ultimately unequal things. This is where human hubris lives._

BUDDHA: _Mmm. Very good. I can sense you are close. But like the forms, you're busy pointing! May I ask, have you ever tried observing?_

NIETZSCHE: _All perception starts out as nerve stimuli, but at this instance, it—whatever it is—has already left the
thing in itself and turned into representation._

BUDDHA: _Have you tried observing this moment? And...this?_

NIETZSCHE: _The distinction between the general—such as time—and individual instance—such as now—is also dogmatic. If it originates from the nature of things, we cannot know. Nonetheless, I shall do as you ask and observe with my own mind's eye._

BUDDHA: _And?_

Ans so they were. Not forms, nor conepts. Monistic, eternal—one and forever.

I don't want to hear what I said, read what I wrote, think what I thought, or know what I knew.

Today is alive, today brings potential.

This day I want to do something else; express the unsaid, appreciate the unseen, and meet someone new.

The past is passed, the passed is dead.

This day we start anew.

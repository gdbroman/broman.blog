Everyday expressions—because of their effective abstractionality—shield off (and unfortunately Pavlovially _discourage_ us from!) fundamental questioning. Everyday expressions are seeming qualitative statements that only reveal themselves as normative at a closer look. E.g. _“airing one’s dirty laundry in public”_ implies a badness of vulnerability through sharing, and this particular saying—which happens to be used by boomers—reflects their valuing of privacy. These types of observations require thought at a lower level. _"First principle thinking"_ as modernity has it, which works—until we hit ground 0. The unspeakable is not silence, it is the ground of language.

The more fundamental the area of inquiry, the more the word muddies the water. Obviously, any abstraction has to quickly rise up into the clouds to provide itself useful. By "merely" communicating we ignore all questions which we'd only consider meaningful at a preverbal, grounded state ("once you label me you negate me" and so on). So oftentimes, the best we can say is nothing at all. And sometimes, the best is not something to do, but to be.

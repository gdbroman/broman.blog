Heyo! I'm Gustaf Broman: Programmer by day, daydreamer by night. This was written at night.

I am a big fan of the human spirit. I believe it is meant to be expressed. I think the decentralization of power—unbundling the government in particular—giving rise to the sovereign individual—is the next natural step in this direction. And with many hurdles ahead, I believe it to be a [bottom-up task](/catconsc).

Lastly, I take speech and conversation as crucial in this steering process. So if you've got any input whatsoever, do reach out. I'm always up for a chat: <a href="mailto:99gustaf@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">99gustaf@gmail.com</a>

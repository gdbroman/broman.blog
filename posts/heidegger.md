Heidegger claims to wake us from oblivion.

That ever since the start of philosophy we've been concerned with being with a lower case b. Simple matters.

Each epoch allows for a certain radicality in worldview. Each time period deliminates a though horizon.

## The end of history

Hiedegger proposes that we are now entering the epoch of a whole world view and the threat of complete instrumentalization of our world via tech.

Threat: beoming more like things than persons.

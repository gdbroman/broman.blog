It's my new favorite motto - isnâ€™t it neat?

Basically, stop fucking thinking. Refining is important, but first we need a draft. Heck, *this* is a draft.

And make it suck: Paint an ugly painting, write an incoherent essay, shoot a boring movie. Because transforming something bad into something good is ten times easier than producing something good from scratch.

Publish at 80%, when you're a little bit embarrassed. If you're not embarrassed, you're not producing enough. It's opposite to what we're taught in school, and it works. It really works.

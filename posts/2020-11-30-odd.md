Once upon a time, on a tiny speck, monkeys became aware, and now theyâ€™re depressed.

So off they went on a meaning quest. They tried with values - grandiose and noble!

And how they searched! But to no avail. They had witnessed the absurd, and there was no going back.

Hopelessness! Despair! What were their options? To continue as regular? As if nothing had happened?

Not with pure will - not even death. Unavoiding, unseeable, absurdity prevailed.

Why hold reason to such high regard? When it cannot provide a meaning in life?

Time is brief, but we are not. May I never mistake a hammer for God.

_"What's the meaning of life?"_ is a meaningless question. It's not the _wrong_ question. It is the act of questioning that is mistaken. The egoic mind playing games. Tricks!

The question only arises in moments lacking meaningful experience. We never ask why whilst in presence.

> People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. **I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive**

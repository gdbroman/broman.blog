Reality appears to be accelerating towards complexity. We do not know what this complexity is. More importantly, our role as human beings in this unfoldment—if we’ll even get to pass through the keyhole—we also do not know.

To complicate the matter, reality seems to dislike being talked about. But there’s a sense in which, through attempting to speak the unspeakable, the understanding of this isness can be accelerated on a larger scale.

## 1 Why Accelerate

_Any world order based on knowledge other than our shared being is at best a fragile alliance. To not become mechanical technocrats, the spirit somehow has to be brought along with us: To not leave our human soul behind, there have to be effective efforts in accelerating awakening. With growing existential risks, large-scale top-down governing is Russian roulette. Consistently wise species-level decision-making has to be done in a many-to-many fashion. The path isn’t quick, but it is necessary, and it starts in Mind._

### 1.1 Fundamental Okayness

In failing to look past evolutionary fear, not much has changed since first leaving the savannah. Physical needs remains the go-to space for seeking wholeness. And it is no doubt that contemporary western ontology, with its dead mechanistic outlook, has contributed to our materialistic worldview in this everyday (and not only metaphysical) sense. But what those letting go of scarcity discover is—if only for a moment—when the fight with fear subsides, a fundamental okayness remains: An inherent joy of being—which doesn't make you complacent, but which makes you okay. More likely to do successful good (such as when seeking to help corners of the world that are actually living in scarcity). So it is from this recognition the future has to be built.

### 1.2 Can We Engineer Enlightenment?

Of course, no effort in engineering enlightenment will ever be complete—will never be _it._ Like the dog fixating on your fingertip, instead of tracing the imaginary line extending beyond it—_this_ can never be explained, never fairly represented, only experienced. But as Picasso said, although art lies, it points to truth. So external efforts may be insufficient, but they are necessary. In other words, there’s stuff to do.

### 1.3 What Is Happening

#### 1.3.1 The Secularization of Meditation

The clinical rebranding of meditation has been two steps forward and one step back. Its nuts and bolts abstracted, and its deeper purpose—of awakening the practitioner—left behind. Meditation apps have played an important role in this spread via secularization. We just have to make sure the discussion doesn’t end with listicles on how a daily practice makes you a more effective worker bee.

#### 1.3.2 The Church of Technology

Secondly, religion has bought new clothes. Technology now has its eyes on the throne of God. When nature is merciless, we consult rationalism—when death discomforts, we turn to transhumanism. I don’t think there‘s reason to reject this sort of religion on principle—as long as we’re honest about that’s what it is. If not, we’ll end up longing for all sacred we’ve dismantled. And without disregarding theological innovation, it is, generally speaking, safer to rely on such technologies that have stood the test of time.

#### 1.3.3 A Psychedelic Renaissance

Mostly through personal accounts online, and a few outspoken celebrities (Joe Rogan, Mike Tyson, Tim Ferriss), psychedelics are making a comeback—and this time with a wider appeal. More states and countries are legalizing; although similar to meditation, it is with industrial practicality as carrot whilst their real power remains largely undiscussed.

#### 1.3.4 Science Turning Its Gaze Inward

Lastly, science is going through an epistemological crisis. We are realizing that science has been operating dogmatically with regards to its metaphysical assumptions. This is understandable. Most fields—given the same societal success as science has had—would have turned equally arrogant.

Outside thinkers and retired academics (for which the shackles of academia aren’t as heavy) are speaking up on podcasts and social platforms about the pseudophilosophy that has been scientism. This is in turn encouraging some brave scientists within the system to address the naked emperor that is “matter.” The two-century-long belief that reality is fundamentally material (which has produced the so-called “hard problem,” as well as—arguably—a meaning crisis in the rest of society) is rising to the surface.

The science community is beginning to realize how admitting its philosophical error—although momentarily painful for its collective ego—won’t eradicate all previous findings, but will instead strengthen its integrity in the long term: How it permits a more solid—indubitably more hopeful—interpretation of what we are doing and why.

## 2 How to Accelerate

Any technology (in the broader sense of the word) which prioritizes human nature (love, kindness, compassion) and decentralizes decision-making, can help us catalyze consciousness, e.g:

- Blockchain & cryptocurrencies can aid the decentralization of power and foster independent thinking.
- VR games & media for induced awakening experiences. Consciousness tech is basically as old as we are (rituals, mind-altering substances, etc.) but there is likely plenty of unexplored territory using modern hardware and software.
- Meetups & gatherings of enlightened individuals (good things happen when conscious people get together—if not only to help others on the path).
- Psychedelics R&D, including funding and legislation.
- Courses & workshops on meditation, yoga, and similar practices. Volunteer or donate to centers. Make initiatives at your workplace, university, community, etc.
- High-quality art & integrous intellectual work: Ideas change the world, and beauty will save it!

Tools are tools. Multiple tools will be required to achieve critical mass for collective awakening. And any tool is inherently neutral, so we must come from a place of joy. Thankfully, it is already waiting.

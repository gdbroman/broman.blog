We seek completion yet there is none.

Anticipating arrival but it’s always forgone.

No destination, and never will be.

An everlasting journey, is all there could be!

Depressing? Grudging?

You do the judging.

We make our own meaning, don’t you see?

Suffering we can transcend.

But never forget: there isn't an end.

It may seem absurd - perhaps make you vengeful?

Ultimately, there's nothing more meaningful.

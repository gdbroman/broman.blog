Life’s messy. _Learning_ is messy. And progress, in the midst of it, seldom seems like it.

Looking back personally, the most valuable lessons have always come from chaotic periods. When it seems like you’re not progressing. Maybe even regressing.

On the flip side; periods of success, when you get to reap the rewards from previous hard work, seldom change you for the better.

But having internalized this, we can remind ourselves in those darker moments: It is now I grow. When learning, you can make peace with the feeling of confusion - realizing that is the hotbed for aha-moments. Understanding must arise out of confusion.

It’s still hard to remember, of course. A part of me still doubts it every time: _“this can’t possibly turn out good.”_ And yet, things have their way of sorting themselves out if you let them.

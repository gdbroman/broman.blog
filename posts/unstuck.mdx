Physicists, engineers, and mathematicians in the 20th century were able to make huge leaps in science and technology. They were able to do this because they had access to healthy consensus-making machines allowing for cross-disciplinary collaboration. One such machine was Bell Labs.

Bell Labs, a spinoff R&D lab of AT&T, was a cross-disciplinary idea factory that produced some of the most important inventions of the 20th century, including the transistor, the laser, and the UNIX operating system. Over its 50-year history, it won nine Nobel prizes.

AT&T was a public company, but managed to long stay a monopoly by playing a vital role in the US military. That was until the 1980s when the US government enacted antitrust laws and forced AT&T to license its patents to anyone who wanted to use them. Today, Bell Labs is a shadow of its former self, and the US military is no longer a customer.

An interesting question is what is the closest equivalent to Bell Labs today? Maybe an attractive answer is OpenAI, but OpenAI is a closed project of narrower scope. I am not questioning the utility of a product like ChatGPT – I am using it to write this very article. And it might one day create "safe AGI," but the company is not yet as exploding and cross-disciplined of an idea factory, leading to as life-changing possibilities like instantaneous, cross-atlantic communication, and modern computing.

But trying to recreate Bell Labs in 2023 would be a mistake for a multitude of reasons. The first being that the frontier is temporal: The telephone is no longer the frontier, and in my humble opinion, neither is AI, as it will not take us out of institutional decay – it's arguably part of it.

This brings us to the most important reason that I would like to think about solving in this article: In 2023 we find ourselves in a situation where the brightest minds and firery spirits struggle to find institutions to support them. William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor, did his doctorate at Caltech and was later recruited by the crazy coallition of minds that was Bell Labs. But had he been born in 1990, he would have either had his spirit crushed in tracked academia, or at best later been fired from Google for having the wrong opinions.

So what is the Bell Labs of 2023? It's important to think about because technological progress is not just about inventing things, it's also about inventing ways of inventing things. Is it not to become a century defined by stagnation, the 21st century is in dire need of new institutions.


## The Internet

The internet is not an institution, it's a network of institutions. And the institutions that are most important to the internet are the ones that are most under attack: The ones that allow for free speech and free association.

But the problem with the internet is that it's virtual and humans are embodied, they need to interact in physical space. So the internet is not enough, we need to think about institutions in physical space.

## Lone Genius Theory

> Physical proximity [to the guy who wrote the book] was everything. p.151

Although Shannon, inventor of information theory, was a loner, he admits Bell Labs as an institution played a vital role in his research and development – as an intellectual environment, the people, and Bell System's myriad of technical challenges. [7, 42, Liversidge, "Profile of Claude Shannon"]

If our institutions would have been working, they wouldn't have been so occupied with trying to deny lone genius theory, it would have been an uninsteresting question. But because the institutions are halting, they need to defend their existence. And because they can't prove themselves through action, they need to deny anyone who tries to exit and try their outside the institution.

## The Tech Frontier is Temporal

> So where are the places where technology is happening? Where is there room for the journey to continue?  The frontier is a promising place, but also a very uncertain one. You can imagine a tech market where nothing is happening for a long time, things suddenly start to happen, and then it all stops. The tech frontier is temporal, not geographical. It’s when things are happening.

## The Frontier is Deserted (Non-Competetive)

AI is definitely not the frontier:

> Since the goal is to build companies that will still be around in 2020, you want to avoid a field where things are moving too quickly. You want to avoid being an innovative but non-profitable disk drive company from the ‘80s.
>

> One way to tell whether you’ve found a good frontier is to answer the question “Why should the 20th employee join your company?” If you have a great answer, you’re on the right track. If not, you’re not. The problem is the question is deceptively easy sounding.

### Tech is political

Technology is political

Because It either centralises or decentralises power and therefore will threaten governments or individuals 

Bell labs decentralized power with tech such as telephone and radio (momentarily centralized)

Manhattan project centralized power

Urbit decentralises

OpenAI centralizes power

## Preface: Trippleblind

There are two senses in which we as a society are epistemologically blind to the frontier.

The first is eternal to all societies: The frontier is narrative-violating and category-defying. It's unknown unknowns. If there's a buzzword for it, it's definitely not the frontier.

The second is tied to our current society: There's a sense in which the frontier has been stolen. It hasn't, but there's a lot of people who want you to believe the status quo is the best possible world. These people reject not only technological innovation but also traditionalism. They neither want to return nor progress, they want you to use their language and think their thoughts. So this is how you're blinded. The frontier is there, but if you can't see it, step one is to realize you're blind.

## Institutions

You will not find novel ideas in institutions.

What is an institution? The obvious ones are media and the state. But also be aware of the subtler ones that will claim to be on the side of progress: tech and academia.

You'll find the progress-deniers concentrated to institutions. The first is "tech", which is now a rentseeking industry. The second is academia, which is now a credentialism industry.

The third, and most dangerous, is tied to both our time and the tech space: The "technologists" of our time have recently turned into rentseekers. 90% of SaaS is rentseeking, they're essentially laundrymats, incredibly tracked. E.g. healthcare sucks. Not because of admin, but because there are too many patients. Problems are not attacked at their root.

The way to break out of the tracks is to reject most institutions, especially academia. There was a time when academia was powerful, e.g. Bell Labs.

But today you must realize that most "education" is "credentialism" (90% – see PT vid). University creates an illusion of competancy. Realize half of the time in academia is wasted on admin. As a self-learner you can be ~100% more effective with no admin and no vendor lock-in. Realize most people don't learn, the bar to knowing is low. Actually try to learn.

### Institutional lag

Tesla clashed with professors over the practicality of direct current (DC) vs alternating current (AC) electrical systems. He was a strong proponent of AC, while his professors favored DC. This ideological rift was significant, as Tesla later revolutionized electrical systems by successfully implementing AC. The disagreement is a testament to how institutional thinking can sometimes lag behind innovative ideas.

## The "Literally Me" Archetype

The "Literally Me" archetype has become synonymous with internet culture over the past couple of years, including fictional characters like Rust Cohle in True Detective, Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and William Foster in Falling Down. The archetype's name derives from the fact that so many viewers indeed feel like the character is "literally me."

But what part of the demographic feel like it is "literally them?" It is certainly not your stay-at-home mom. It is often young guys working a 9-5. To understand why, it's necessary to understand what the archetype represents. Many of the fictional "literally me" characters are nihilists whilst still being portrayed as "right" in some sense. They are right in the sense that they are pointing out the absurdity of the status quo, and this makes people feel heard. That yes the status quo is absurd, I'm not crazy, it's the institutions that have failed me.

## Frontiers of the Past

Looking back can help us look forward.

### 1/ Bell Labs

A good reminder that idea factories are possible, and history tells us the physical space – the people it gathers and how it organizes them – is important.

The importance of mixing different disciplines, often with tension.

### 2/ Manhattan Project

The Manhattan Project shows us the value of having a domain-literate leader. Oppenheimer was a physicist, and he was able to lead the project because he understood the science. He was able to make decisions and tradeoffs that a non-physicist would not have been able to make.

### 3/ Apple

A healthy reminder of the narrow-mindedness of the Y-Combinator philosophy. Jobs and Woz didn't set up a landing page with an email form and a "sign up" button. They built a computer in a garage.

But Apple didn't rely on an institution as much as Bell Labs or the Manhattan project, which is what makes it such a good role model for our time. It was a company, and it was a company that was able to make huge leaps in technology.

## The Problem with AI

I told my ChatGPT preferences that I'm moderately sceptical to mainstream science, and now it just self-describes its answers as "non-mainstream" lol

## My Map for 2023

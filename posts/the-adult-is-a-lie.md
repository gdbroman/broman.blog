I just discovered Santa Claus doesn’t exist. And by Santa Claus I mean adults. Adults do not exist.

The other day I witnessed a man die. He was a neighbor of mine and we had had a pretty good relationship.

As I sat down by his hospital bed, I felt relief. He was 95 years old and had been suffering lately. But I primarily felt uniquely present. Once again I was reminded. _This shit ends._ How we live out our days like we have an endless supply. As if we’ll always get another chance. We won’t. We know we won’t—some moment will have to be our last. But we forget in humdrum. Except for in certain moments. Like in the presence of death.

As I walked out of the hospital room, having said goodbye, one visitor asked the doctor if the dying are able to hear us when we address them? The doctor replied, _“They say that semi-conscious people can actually hear others, even if they are unable to speak themselves.”_ The visitor smiled, nodded and left.

_“THEY SAY.”_ Who are _they_? Presumably people who have thought about the brain a lot. Researchers, academics. Can you really know what someone’s subjective experience is through a brain scan? I reckoned it could give you a hint. Then I also nodded and left.

So much of civilized human experience relies on people knowing what to do, how to do it, and when. We have made an abstraction of this which we call “adults.”

An “adult” is someone responsible. Someone who you can rely on and who can answer your questions. Someone who gets things done and knows how stuff works.

When the car gets broken down, we call the competent mechanic to fix it for us. In social unrest we turn on the TV and listen to experts to tell us what's up. When our beloved is dying, we turn to the doctor for status reports. To answer our questions.

It seems like we are surrounded by adults. But let's for a moment think about what we do _not_ see. What you don't see is that the skilled car mechanic is also clueless with women.

That the confident news anchor on TV recently had a fight with her husband and is now living with her mother. That the knowledgeable doctor who you turned to for answers is depressed, prays to God every single night, and is as clueless as you about what death really entails.

We do not see these things because people never share them. They are what we call _“private.”_ Modern man lives a doubled life: one private, one public.

At home we get to do what we like. Watch our embarrassing TV-shows, dance shamelessly, sing and cry. We get to be ourselves. But the moment we step out our front door, a _shell_ is put on. A shell in the form of achievements, conveniently hiding our flaws. We turn _“professional.”_

We smile and tell everyone about what’s going so great in our lives. Never revealing our innermost content, because that would make us vulnerable. Consequently, we perceive everyone as flawless, happy human beings. Whereas we can only verify how untrue that is for ourselves.

Living this sort of doubled life is very unfortunate for everyone’s—but especially our own—wellbeing. Because whilst comfortable to conceal large chunks of ourselves in the moment, it will ultimately make us feel, what you might choose to call, "unwhole.” Superficial. A fraud always on the verge of being found out. Not being ourselves. Never _finding_ ourselves.

Not suggesting we should dance naked in the streets and tell our deepest secrets to strangers. Most likely, that’s not something you’d identify with neither. Instead, we might propose bringing the public and private self closer. Maybe they can meet somewhere in the middle.

This might mean letting loose a bit more in public, and at the same time taking your alone time more seriously. To reveal something embarrassing you did yesterday to your co-worker, and read a novel instead of watching TV before bed. Maybe even contemplate death à la the stoics. Internalizing the scarcity of life provides a great deal of courage—like for opening up.

Yesterday I realized the adult is a lie. An unreachable abstraction. Everyone we like to think of as happy, perfect human beings, we probably need to spend some more time around. A genius is someone we haven’t got to know yet.

But it is through bridging the gap between our two selves that we can mature. Not wearing a shell as a fear response, but instead cultivating a personality that is somewhat constant throughout environments, regardless of who’s watching. To become whole. This is what it should mean to become an adult.

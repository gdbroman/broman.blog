> I am afraid there will be little tangible left in a later age, to remind our heirs that we were men, rather than cogs in a machine.

By the end of the 20th century we had completed the denial of our own nature. First physically, with the invention of the atom bomb; and second psychologically, with the booming commercialization of the personal computer. It is common to focus on the paralyzing effect these two events have had on geopolitics, but less so on their impact on the very systems that led to their creation. The 21st century is what happens when you remove the two most powerful, natural motivators for innovation: violence and boredom. The solution to the fermi paradox is not that civilizations blow themselves up, but that they seduce themselves to death. The entertainment isn't stopping any time soon, so the question becomes not whether we can outdo the 20th century, but whether we can outdo the 20th century without war.

In the 20th century, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians made civilizational leaps in faster intervals than an average US city repairs its potholes today. They were able to do this because they had a fire under their ass forcing wide cross-disciplinary collaboration. The most impactful such collaboration was Bell Labs.

Bell Labs, a spinoff R&D lab of AT&T, produced the most transformative inventions of the last decade, including the transistor, the laser, fiber optics, the communication sattelite, the telephone, and the UNIX operating system. Over its 50-year history, it won nine Nobel prizes, and laid the foundation for the personal computer. In terms of broad, positive societal impact, Bell Labs might take the cake as the most successful science and technology project known to history.

But with the benefit of hindsight, the 20th century also put a fork in progress. In 2023 we find ourselves in a situation where the brightest young turks struggle to find institutions to support them. William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor, did his doctorate at Caltech and was later recruited by the coalition of idiosyncratic minds that was Bell Labs. But had he been born in 1990, he would have either had his spirit crushed in tracked academia, perhaps sidetracked by the minutia of quantum gravity, or at best later been fired from Google for his views on race and intelligence. When telecommunication is no longer the frontier, one shouldn't suppress the very types of minds that could discover teleportation.

But trying to recreate Bell Labs in 2023 would be a mistake for multiple reasons, although in many ways, that's what we've been trying to do (Google / big tech). The obvious being that the frontier is temporal, and the telephone is no longer the frontier: And as we claim here, neither is software. But the far more pernicious reason is that the institutions that Bell Labs relied on are dead; war is no longer a motivator, academia is a credentialism industry, and regulation has made it harder to innovate anywhere that isn't online. And while there is some value in trying to reform from the inside in Washington, DC, or Cambridge, MA, it's no doubt harder than starting anew, so here we explore what such new institutions might look like.

## Stuck in Commercialization

If 1925, with the founding of Bell Labs, to 1969, with Apollo 11 landing on the moon, was a period of research; then 1969 to 1977, with the release of Apple II marking the peak of Silicon Valley, was a period of development; and 1977 to today has been a period of commercialization. If it is not to close out as a century defined by mere globalization, the 21st century is in dire need of healthy research institutions. But what big institution is currently conducting cross-disciplinary, blue-sky research?

Google has famously gone above and beyond to copy the Bell Labs model. It's arguably a monopoly with great cash reserves, which it has used to build sprawling campuses and informal office environments aimed at fostering creativity. And they pay high multiples of the market rate for ostensibly the brightest minds. Google even has the 20% rule which encourages employees to spend 20% of their time on side projects not directly related to their main tasks in order to inspire exploration. The 20% rule was directly inspired by Bell Labs philosophy on exploration and has led to some of Google's successful products like Gmail and Google News. But as Charles Peirce feared, *"I am afraid there will be little tangible left in a later age, to remind our heirs that we were men, rather than cogs in a machine."* <sup>1</sup> Like the amateur cyclist suited up with all the expensive gear, Google has managed to learn for Bell Labs in all the ways that don't matter. The problem is that the Google engineer will not build mechanical maze-solving mice in his spare time, but instead read "The Lean Startup" and practice Leetcode. And while the Google engineer is certainly smart, he is fundamentally of a different breed than Shannon and Shockley. Pirates aren't bought with a nice boat – they pledge their allegiance to whoever is going out on a great adventure with the slight possibility of loot and glory. And because Google lacks adventure, naturally it attracts maintainers and not pirates.

Another tempting contemporary Bell Labs analogue may be OpenAI. And while it's not yet as tracked as the rest of big tech, it's a closed project of narrower scope. The transistor was a multidisciplinary achievement involving solid state physics, material science, electrical engineering, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. ChatGPT was built using all but one of those disciplines. This is not a competition in what project can invoke the highest number of disciplines. Nor am I questioning the utility of a product like ChatGPT – I am using it to write this very article. And OpenAI might one day create "safe AGI," but the company is not yet as exploding and cross-disciplined of an idea factory as Bell Labs was.

But where can one go to learn all these disciplines? Out of all of the STEM fields, computer science, a subfield of mathematics, is arguably the easiest to self-study, which in part explains why software has become such a popoular resort for the institutionless and benefited from an explosion in creativity thus. The colleges will deny the effectiveness of self-study no matter the field; that knowledge acquired in one's chamber is somehow inferior to knowledge acquired in a classroom setting. The reactionary view becomes that there is no value whatsoever to communal learning. But as with most extremist positions, they're a tell that both parties are overcompensating. If there was nothing to miss out on, the dropout would not feel the need to constantly assert it. Likewise, if our institutions would have been working, they wouldn't have been so occupied with trying to deny lone genius theory, it would have been a non-issue. But as a culture we are still overindexed on college, so I will not countersignal the dropout anymore. And because the colleges are halting, they need to defend their existence at the slightest hint of threat. And because they can't deliver the results, they need to deny anyone who tries to exit and try their luck outside the institution.

The most recent company that can hold its own against the inventions of Bell Labs is Apple. Apple was founded in 1976, and in its first 20 years it completely defined a new era of personal computing and technology business. Apple would not have been able to do this without Steve Jobs' vision. Had he and Woz followed the sort of random-walk advice that YC gives, they would have ended up with a landing page and an email form. Instead they built a computer in a garage. When Bell Labs was first developing the mobile phone, all of their marketing studies concluded that "there was no market for mobile phones at any price."<sup>1</sup> Engel, the head of the mobile development, later came to believe that marketing studies could only tell you something about the demand for products that already exist. Steve Jobs had a similar view that people don't know what they want until you show it to them.

But even Apple was a project of commercialization, Apple didn't make breakthrough discoveries, but rather took the inventions of Bell Labs and made them accessible to the masses. And this Sillicon Valley-fication has only gotten worse in the recent decade. East-coast entrepreneurs are still living off the dividends from half a century old ideas. We're stuck in rentseeking with too much Edison and not enough Tesla. The old ideas are exhausted, people are overspecialized, research projects are siloed in private companies, and we confuse tech and commercialization (p.344).

Another tempting answer is the San-Francisco-based startup incubator Y-Combinator. YC has produced some of the highest market capitalizations of the 21st century, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. Again I pose the question whether these services have accelerated civilization to the same degree as the transistor? Fundamentally, YC adherents don't believe their brains, or at best they outsource thinking to AI. Instead of envisioning the future they ask Joe on the street what he craves and fills that need. "Make something people want" is great business advice, but if what people want is a faster horse, you'll be stuck in commercialization.

This leaves us with all but one contemporary institution that is imperfect yet has the potential to break through the institutional decay: the internet.

## The Internet as a Denial of Human Nature

> I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.
> <cite>–Tyler Durden</cite>

While Bell Labs left a blueprint for innovation, we've learnt from it in all the ways that don't matter.

The problem with the internet is that it doesn't offer the same adventure as crossing the Atlantic for the first time, or racing against the Soviets to the atom bomb. In contrast to Bell Labs, the internet isn't teleological. The facilitattion of unrestricted flow of information isn't rooted in a deep need like survival, or virtue like glory. This meaninglessness recently reflects itself in culture with the "Literally Me" meme.

The "Literally Me" meme portrays an archetype represented by fictional characters like Rust Cohle in True Detective, and William Foster in Falling Down, and Tyler Durden in Fight Club. The archetype's name derives from the fact that so many viewers indeed feel like the character is "literally me." What part of the demographic feel like it is "literally them?" It is certainly not your grandparents, it is frustrated 20-plus guys who feel betrayed by society. To understand why, it's necessary to understand what the archetype represents. Many of the fictional "literally me" characters are nihilists whilst still being portrayed as "right" in some sense. They are right in the sense that they are pointing out the absurdity and disappointment of the status quo, and this makes people feel heard. Young men used to be able to exercise their adventourous spirit in war or sailing the seas, or satiate their intellectual hunger in academia. But now all the seas are explored, the wars are fake, and a degree doesn't mean anything anymore. The litterally me phenomenon represents the frustration of having these natural instincts denied.

Furthermore, the internet denies the embodied nature of humans. Contrary to what many propagated during the remote-boom of 2021, innovation is slower in virtual space, humans need to interact in physical space to feel alive and use our fullest potential. So the internet is not enough, but luckily there's a solution for instantiating value-driven communities in physical space: the network state.

## The Network State as a Tool for Innovation

The Network State is how you solve the internet's denial of nature. But (Balaji-critique), **The Network State should not bee seen as an end in and of itself, whether political or spiritual, much more interesting is to view it as a new form of institution, a tool that can facilitate innovation.** As a bonus, real innovation, is the most powerful way of surpassing legacy nation's GDP and thus achieving recognition as a sovereign state. The Network State is a tool for innovation, and innovation is a tool for sovereignty.

Innovating is also a moral imperative. There is a plethora of domains in which we're in a local optimum. There has never been a point in history with so much obesity, demensia, and mental illness. Give the market time and it will cheapen alternative food ingredients inflammatory seed oils and high-fructose corn syrup. We can't stop here. We need to innovate.

Viewing the network state merely as a solution to regulation or political inertia is not enough, it has been tried. <sup>3</sup> Instead it needs to be treated as a return to human nature by heeding the instinctive call to adventure.

### The Causes of Innovation

> Physical proximity [to the guy who wrote the book] was everything. p.151

So what causes innovation? It's important to think about because technological progress is not just about inventing things, it's also about inventing ways of inventing things.

- Federal funding / monopoly as a enabler of long runway / breathing room for bluesky research (p.352)
  - Competition causes incremental improvements, monopoly enables breakthroughs
- War

Organization of capital requires monopoly. See what happened to Bell Labs, only during their monopoly phase were they innovative.

Organization people means physical proximity to geniuses, and this requires prestige to attract those people. It requires telling a bold story that convinces geniuses that this is the most important project in the history of man and will make a shit-ton of money in the case of success. Tell the story that you're just trying to make money and you'll attract rentseekers. Tell the story that you're only doing social justice and you won't have any pull.

Do modern institutions have these things? Capital perhaps, but prestige is dead.

And the guy who wrote the book on circuits, information theory, or electromagnetism, is not next door, but dead. A whole generation of scientists are being bred that conceptualize science not as a process but a static body of knowledge.

Realism: Yes it would have been better if science could collaborate at the scale of old academia but the situation requires more siloed efforts from private parties

### The Limits of Venture Capital

> We don't fund science experiments (p.348)

TL;DR we need war, pirates, and cowboys.

It can't just be, think of the wackiest ideas you can imagine, then you get Jason Reza Jorjani. It needs to be motivated by necessity, not just a desire to be fringe. That necessity can be life or death (war), or spiritual life or death (virtue). JFK.

Innovation requires organization – of capital, and people.

But war is a more powerful motivator than capital.

Apollo 11 was the last time we were ONE. Our Niel Armstrong is Brian Armstrong building a crypto exchange.

There's a sense in which Bell Labs feels instinctively anachronistic. The surface-level explanation is the old school dress code, and the frequent cigaratte breaks. Both overlooked practices that contribute to a culture of seriousness and socialization. The deeper explanation is that prestige is dead.

Bell labs engineers were not granted stock options. At Bell Labs, the primary incentives were intellectual freedom, resources, and the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects that could change the world. Adventure. The prestige of Bell Labs attracted top talent who were driven more by the pursuit of innovation and discovery than financial gain. The opportunity to be in walking distance of "the guy who wrote the book on" any science topic, and in fact encouraged by management to never hesitate going ask these brilliant minds for help. It was a different era and business model, less about quick profits and more about laying the groundwork for entire industries.

### BUILDINGS

> Kelly considered the design of the building—where research scientists and development engineers from all disciplines were housed together in close proximity—yet another grand Bell Labs invention.

A big reason why tech is stuck is because of remote work. Remote work has been a powerful globalizing force, but let's not confuse quantity for quality – it hasn't led to new innovations.

The "technologists" of our time have recently turned into rentseekers. 90% of SaaS is rentseeking, they're essentially laundrymats, incredibly tracked. As long as we're all interacting through web apps, that's what we'll build. It's like college students who can only come up with business ideas for college students. All of tech is converging towards the same level of sophistication as a laundrymat.

One of the most important factors in science is sharing ideas and information, have a bunch of siloed research companies isn't optimal. On the other hand, some competition is good too. E.g. countries going to war.

### My Map for 2023 (Network-state projects)

What Comes After The Information Age? What does post-Bell-Labian progress look like?

no matter what the deep-state program is, technology is the weapon at your disposal. technology is political and disrupts power structures

Tech is a destructive force (p. 359)

#### 1/ Post-Einsteinian Physics

Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / study ancient egypt / reverse-engineer UFOs)

RESEARCHERS WANTED: You will be sifting ancient Sumerian texts in university libraries, decoding Egyptian runes, and have months of ontological shock with constant coffee jitters. Return to shared reality doubtful. Immense civilizational and personal wealth in case of success.

##### It's not all cultural degeneration

there are also intentional Sidetrackers

Also Electrodynamics (telsa did great progress and then it stopped)

Research Institute of Advanced study.

Sidetrackers after Einstein:
- Wolfgang pauli
- fermi
- dirac
- Wittens

#### 2/ Resilient Computing

Holium / Urbit

#### 3/ Anti-Fakeness

Zorp / ZK proofs

#### 4/ Resilient finance

Bitcoin

#### 5/ Healthy Living

Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat)

#### 6/ Energy too Cheap to Meter

Nuclear / Cold fusion

#### 7/ Consciousness

Howard Hughes Medical Institute

#### 8/ Science Philantropy

Jim Simons

#### 9/ Expeditions

All of these projects can synergize in a network state setting. Expeditions is a way to create a strong culture and attract talent.

## Conclusion

Am I romanticising a past I wasn’t in to experience? The counter argument is looking at the outcomes: what inventions did it lead to? What inventions are we producing?

If you seek Assymetrical upside For both society and yourself, live by the mantra: If the whole world is learning how to fight, You should be learning how to dance.

There is no formula for the institutionless? Formula: long substance, short status.

Is there a hybrid path where we don't completely replace the old institutions with web3 etc? Yes I think it's a healthy approach to also try to reform the old institutions, but not necessarily from within. Intelligence is real, people just don't think. So thinking is the decentralized remedy to institutional decay.

The void must be filled by network states, or it will be filled by a new system of domination. Postscript on the societies of control.

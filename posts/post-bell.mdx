{/* Did we just move creativity into the world of bits because that's where war is currently being conducted?

Had we just had phones, innovation would still happen in meatspace, because we would need to defend ourselves.

And had we just had the atomic bomb, innovation would still happen in meatspace, because we would have been bored.

It's the combination that is deadly.

-- */}

In the 20th century, we went on sabbatical. The retreat began physically, with the invention of the atomic bomb, and was concluded virtually, with the booming commercialization of the personal computer. It is common to think of the paralyzing effect these two events have had on megapolitics, but less so what happens to progress itself when you remove the two most powerful, natural motivators for new ideas. With near-zero violence and boredom, the beginning of the 21st century hints at an empirical answer to the Fermi Paradox; not that civilizations blow themselves up, but that they seduce themselves into retirement. With Soma but a click away, the question becomes not whether we can outdo the 20th century, but whether we can do so without physical war.

Fifty years ago, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians finished a fifty-year sprint that shipped the transistor, the laser, fiber optics, the communication satellite, the telephone, and the UNIX operating system, enabling the move from physical to virtual space. Bell Labs, a spinoff R&D lab of AT&T, and arguably the most successful science and technology project known to history, was able to do this not because its scientists were of different genetic makeup, but because they had access to healthy consensus-making machines, facilitating wide, cross-disciplinary collaboration, fueled in big part by the threat of Germany and the USSR.

In stark contrast, the 21st century starts out confused. William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor, was born in 1910, did his doctorate at Caltech and was later recruited by the band of cowboys that was Bell Labs. But had he been born in 1990, he would have either had his spirit crushed in tracked academia, perhaps sidetracked by the minutia of quantum gravity, or at best later been fired from Google for his views on race and intelligence. We seem to forget that science is not a body of knowledge, but a process fueled by errors, and that when the frontier is no longer the telephone, one shouldn't exile the very types of minds that could discover teleportation.

Further illustrating the decay of academia, there could be nothing more anachronistic than the opening sequence of the 2001 movie, A Beautiful Mind. The scene is set in 1947, and the protagonist, John Nash, is one of a dozen young mathematicians who have just arrived at Princeton University. The students, all clad in sharlpy tailored plaid suits, are seated in the mathematics department lounge with tobacco smoke in the air and portraits of great thinkers gracing the dark-mahogany walls, listening to the dean's greeting speech:

> Mathematicians won the war. Mathematicians broke the Japanese codes... and built the A-bomb. Mathematicians... like you. The stated goal of the Soviets is global Communism. In medicine or economics, in technology or space, battle lines are being drawn. To triumph, we need results. Publishable, applicable results. Now who among you will be the next Morse? The next Einstein? Who among you will be the vanguard of democracy, freedom, and discovery? Today, we bequeath America's future into your able hands. Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

With academia no longer supporting unconvential thinking, much talent finds itself instead drawn to more vital institutions like Silicon Valley. And this in part provides a sociological explanation of the stagnation of the physical sciences. But Silicon Valley has its own set of issues. For one it has tried to formalize Bell Labs. But the far more pernicious issue is that has been living off of the same set of 50-year old ideas produced by research institutions that are now dead. And while it's possible to reform from the inside of Washington, DC, or Cambridge, MA, it at this point seems easier starting anew.

## Stuck in Commercialization

If the founding of Bell Labs in 1925 marks the start of a period of research, and Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969 marking the start of a period of development, then the release of Apple II in 1977 marks the peak of Silicon Valley, and the start of a period of commercialization. If it is not to close out as a century defined by globalized rentseeking, the 21st century is in dire need of turn-around research. But technological progress is not just about inventing things, it's also about inventing ways of inventing things.

Google has famously gone above and beyond to copy the Bell Labs model. With its great cash reserves, it has built sprawling campuses and informal office environments aimed at fostering creativity. And they pay high multiples of the market rate for ostensibly the brightest minds. Google even has the 20% rule which encourages employees to spend 20% of their time on side projects not directly related to their main tasks in order to inspire exploration. The 20% rule was directly inspired by Bell Labs philosophy on exploration and has led to some of Google's successful products like Gmail and Google News. But as Charles Peirce feared, *"I am afraid there will be little tangible left in a later age, to remind our heirs that we were men, rather than cogs in a machine."* <sup>1</sup> Like the amateur cyclist suited up with all the expensive gear, Google has managed to learn for Bell Labs in all the ways that don't matter. The problem is that the Google engineer will not build mechanical maze-solving mice in his spare time, but instead read "The Lean Startup" and practice Leetcode. And while the Google engineer is certainly smart, he is fundamentally of a different breed than Shannon and Shockley. Pirates aren't bought with a nice boat – they pledge their allegiance to whoever is going out on a great adventure with the slight possibility of loot and glory. And because Google lacks adventure, naturally it attracts maintainers and not pirates.

Another tempting contemporary Bell Labs analogue may be OpenAI. And while it's not yet as tracked as the rest of big tech, it's a closed project of narrower scope. The transistor was a multidisciplinary achievement involving solid state physics, material science, electrical engineering, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. ChatGPT was built using all but one of those disciplines. This is not a competition in what project can invoke the highest number of disciplines. Nor am I questioning the utility of a product like ChatGPT – I am using it to write this very article. And OpenAI might one day create "safe AGI," but the company is not yet as exploding and cross-disciplined of an idea factory as Bell Labs was.

But where can one go to learn all these disciplines? Out of all of the STEM fields, computer science, a subfield of mathematics, is arguably the easiest to self-study, which in part explains why software has become such a popoular resort for the institutionless and benefited from an explosion in creativity thus. The colleges will deny the effectiveness of self-study no matter the field; that knowledge acquired in one's chamber is somehow inferior to knowledge acquired in a classroom setting. The reactionary view becomes that there is no value whatsoever to communal learning. But as with most extremist positions, they're a tell that both parties are overcompensating. If there was nothing to miss out on, the dropout would not feel the need to constantly assert it. Likewise, if our institutions would have been working, they wouldn't have been so occupied with trying to deny lone genius theory, it would have been a non-issue. But as a culture we are still overindexed on college, so I will not countersignal the dropout anymore. And because the colleges are halting, they need to defend their existence at the slightest hint of threat. And because they can't deliver the results, they need to deny anyone who tries to exit and try their luck outside the institution.

The most recent company that can hold its own against the inventions of Bell Labs is Apple. Apple was founded in 1976, and in its first 20 years it completely defined a new era of personal computing and technology business. Apple would not have been able to do this without Steve Jobs' vision. Had he and Woz followed the sort of random-walk advice that YC gives, they would have ended up with a landing page and an email form. Instead they built a computer in a garage. When Bell Labs was first developing the mobile phone, all of their marketing studies concluded that "there was no market for mobile phones at any price."<sup>1</sup> Engel, the head of the mobile development, later came to believe that marketing studies could only tell you something about the demand for products that already exist. Steve Jobs had a similar view that people don't know what they want until you show it to them.

But even Apple was a project of commercialization, Apple didn't make breakthrough discoveries, but rather took the inventions of Bell Labs and made them accessible to the masses. And this Sillicon Valley-fication has only gotten worse in the recent decade. East-coast entrepreneurs are still living off the dividends from half a century old ideas. We're stuck in rentseeking with too much Edison and not enough Tesla. The old ideas are exhausted, people are overspecialized, research projects are siloed in private companies, and we confuse tech and commercialization (p.344).

Another tempting answer is the San-Francisco-based startup incubator Y-Combinator. YC has produced some of the highest market capitalizations of the 21st century, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. Again I pose the question whether these services have accelerated civilization to the same degree as the transistor? Fundamentally, YC adherents don't believe their brains, or at best they outsource thinking to AI. Instead of envisioning the future they ask Joe on the street what he craves and fills that need. "Make something people want" is great business advice, but if what people want is a faster horse, you'll be stuck in commercialization.

This leaves us with all but one contemporary institution that is imperfect yet has the potential to break through the institutional decay: the internet.

## The War is Virtual

Physical war is no longer a motivator, instead its virtual. But because the US government is incomptent in IT, it's outsourced to private companies. Although they don't even have a map of the landscape. Then you get a phenomonon like Sam Altman voluntarily speaking to congress.

In one word, we're distracted. By our phones, and the ideas they feed us.

China?

Tech has been co-opted

how to escape the Bellian freeze/winter

> I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.
> <cite>–Tyler Durden</cite>

While Bell Labs left a blueprint for new ideas, we've learnt from it in all the ways that don't matter.

The problem with the internet is that it doesn't offer the same adventure as crossing the Atlantic for the first time, or racing against the Sovjets to the atom bomb. In contrast to Bell Labs, the internet isn't teleological. The facilitattion of unrestricted flow of information isn't rooted in a deep need like survival, or virtue like glory. This meaninglessness recently reflects itself in culture with the "Literally Me" meme.

The "Literally Me" meme portrays an archetype represented by fictional characters like Rust Cohle in True Detective, and William Foster in Falling Down, and Tyler Durden in Fight Club. The archetype's name derives from the fact that so many viewers indeed feel like the character is "literally me." What part of the demographic feel like it is "literally them?" It is certainly not your grandparents, it is frustrated 20-plus guys who feel betrayed by society. To understand why, it's necessary to understand what the archetype represents. Many of the fictional "literally me" characters are nihilists whilst still being portrayed as "right" in some sense. They are right in the sense that they are pointing out the absurdity and disappointment of the status quo, and this makes people feel heard. Young men used to be able to exercise their adventourous spirit in war or sailing the seas, or satiate their intellectual hunger in academia. But now all the seas are explored, the wars are fake (virtual, the logic of violence has changed<sup>2</sup>), and a degree doesn't mean anything anymore. The litterally me phenomenon represents the frustration of having these natural instincts denied.

Furthermore, the internet denies the embodied nature of humans. Contrary to what many propagated during the remote-boom of 2021, new ideas is slower in virtual space, humans need to interact in physical space to feel alive and use our fullest potential. So the internet is not enough, but luckily there's a solution for instantiating value-driven communities in physical space: the network state.

## From Normal Science to Turn-Around Research

When telecommunication is no longer the frontier, one shouldn't suppress the very types of minds that could discover teleportation.

Progress depends on error-making, so a high tolerance for wrongthink is imperative.<sup>2</sup> In science, there are three phases a field can be in: pre-paradigm, paradigm, revolutionary phase. Most of science is currently in the paradigm phase where all knowledge is in an esoteric silo where the members of the community communicate exclusively to each other. Normal science does not seek novelty, it is only interested in testing and extending the current paradigm. Although events like covid has accelerated the transition to the revolutionary phase.

The turn-around scientists of the 21st century will be dropouts and excommunicados. The individual needs to be green enough that they haven't been indoctrinated into the current paradigm.

## The Network State as a Tool for New Ideas

And a way back to meatspace.

The Network State is how you solve the internet's denial of nature. But (Balaji-critique), **The Network State should not bee seen as an end in and of itself, whether political or spiritual, much more interesting is to view it as a new form of institution, a tool that can facilitate new ideas.** As a bonus, real new ideas, is the most powerful way of surpassing legacy nation's GDP and thus achieving recognition as a sovereign state. The Network State is a tool for new ideas, and new ideas is a tool for sovereignty.

Innovating is also a moral imperative. There is a plethora of domains in which we're in a local optimum. There has never been a point in history with so much obesity, demensia, and mental illness. Give the market time and it will cheapen alternative food ingredients inflammatory seed oils and high-fructose corn syrup. We can't stop here. We need to innovate.

Viewing the network state merely as a solution to regulation or political inertia is not enough, it has been tried. <sup>3</sup> Instead it needs to be treated as a return to human nature by heeding the instinctive call to adventure.

### The Causes of New ideas

> Physical proximity [to the guy who wrote the book] was everything. p.151

So what causes new ideas? It's important to think about because technological progress is not just about inventing things, it's also about inventing ways of inventing things.

- Federal funding / monopoly as a enabler of long runway / breathing room for bluesky research (p.352)
  - Competition causes incremental improvements, monopoly enables breakthroughs
- War

Organization of capital requires monopoly. See what happened to Bell Labs, only during their monopoly phase were they innovative.

Organization people means physical proximity to geniuses, and this requires prestige to attract those people. It requires telling a bold story that convinces geniuses that this is the most important project in the history of man and will make a shit-ton of money in the case of success. Tell the story that you're just trying to make money and you'll attract rentseekers. Tell the story that you're only doing social justice and you won't have any pull.

Do modern institutions have these things? Capital perhaps, but prestige is dead.

And the guy who wrote the book on circuits, information theory, or electromagnetism, is not next door, but dead. A whole generation of scientists are being bred that conceptualize science not as a process but a static body of knowledge.

Realism: Yes it would have been better if science could collaborate at the scale of old academia but the situation requires more siloed efforts from private parties

### The Limits of Venture Capital

> We don't fund science experiments (p.348)

TL;DR we need war, pirates, and cowboys.

It can't just be, think of the wackiest ideas you can imagine, then you get Jason Reza Jorjani. It needs to be motivated by necessity, not just a desire to be fringe. That necessity can be life or death (war), or spiritual life or death (virtue). JFK.

New ideas requires organization – of capital, and people.

But war is a more powerful motivator than capital.

Apollo 11 was the last time we were ONE. Our Niel Armstrong is Brian Armstrong building a crypto exchange.

There's a sense in which Bell Labs feels instinctively anachronistic. The surface-level explanation is the old school dress code, and the frequent cigaratte breaks. Both overlooked practices that contribute to a culture of seriousness and socialization. The deeper explanation is that prestige is dead.

Bell labs engineers were not granted stock options. At Bell Labs, the primary incentives were intellectual freedom, resources, and the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects that could change the world. Adventure. The prestige of Bell Labs attracted top talent who were driven more by the pursuit of new ideas and discovery than financial gain. The opportunity to be in walking distance of "the guy who wrote the book on" any science topic, and in fact encouraged by management to never hesitate going ask these brilliant minds for help. It was a different era and business model, less about quick profits and more about laying the groundwork for entire industries.

### BUILDINGS

> Kelly considered the design of the building—where research scientists and development engineers from all disciplines were housed together in close proximity—yet another grand Bell Labs invention.

A big reason why tech is stuck is because of remote work. Remote work has been a powerful globalizing force, but let's not confuse quantity for quality – it hasn't led to new new ideass.

The "technologists" of our time have recently turned into rentseekers. 90% of SaaS is rentseeking, they're essentially laundrymats, incredibly tracked. As long as we're all interacting through web apps, that's what we'll build. It's like college students who can only come up with business ideas for college students. All of tech is converging towards the same level of sophistication as a laundrymat.

One of the most important factors in science is sharing ideas and information, have a bunch of siloed research companies isn't optimal. On the other hand, some competition is good too. E.g. countries going to war.

### My Map for 2023 (Network-state projects)

What Comes After The Information Age? What does post-Bell-Labian progress look like?

no matter what the deep-state program is, technology is the weapon at your disposal. technology is political and disrupts power structures

All of these projects can synergize in a network state setting. Expeditions is a way to create a strong culture and attract talent.

## Conclusion

Am I romanticising a past I wasn’t in to experience? The counter argument is looking at the outcomes: what inventions did it lead to? What inventions are we producing?

If you seek Assymetrical upside For both society and yourself, live by the mantra: If the whole world is learning how to fight, You should be learning how to dance.

There is no formula for the institutionless? Formula: long substance, short status.

Is there a hybrid path where we don't completely replace the old institutions with web3 etc? Yes I think it's a healthy approach to also try to reform the old institutions, but not necessarily from within. Intelligence is real, people just don't think. So thinking is the decentralized remedy to institutional decay.

The void must be filled by network states, or it will be filled by a new system of domination. Postscript on the societies of control.

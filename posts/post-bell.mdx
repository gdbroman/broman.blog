The 20th century put a fork in progress. There's a time before the personal computer, and there's a time after, in which our work, leisure, and even relationships, will never be the same. In the 20th century, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians were altering the trajectory of humanity with shorter intervals than the US builds overpasses today. They were able to do this because they had access to healthy consensus-making machines allowing for cross-disciplinary collaboration. The most successful of such collaborations was Bell Labs.

Bell Labs, a spinoff R&D lab of AT&T, produced the most important inventions of the 20th century, including the transistor, the laser, and the UNIX operating system. Over its 50-year history, it won nine Nobel prizes, and laid the foundation for the personal computer. In terms of broad, positive societal impact, Bell Labs might take the cake as the most successful science and technology project known to history.

AT&T was a public company, but managed to long stay a monopoly by playing a vital role in the US military. That was until the 1980s when the US government enacted antitrust laws and forced AT&T to license out its patents to anyone who wanted to use them. Today, Bell Labs is but a shadow of its former self, and the US military is no longer a customer.

An interesting question is what the closest equivalent is to Bell Labs today? A tempting answer may be OpenAI, but OpenAI is a closed project of narrower scope. The transistor was a multidisciplinary achievement involving solid state physics, material science, electrical engineering, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. ChatGPT was built using all but one of those disciplines. This is not a competition in what project can invoke the highest number of disciplines. Nor am I questioning the utility of a product like ChatGPT – I am using it to write this very article. And OpenAI might one day create "safe AGI," but the company is not yet as exploding and cross-disciplined of an idea factory, leading to as life-changing possibilities like instantaneous, cross-Atlantic communication and modern computing.

But trying to recreate Bell Labs in 2023 would be a mistake for a multitude of reasons. The first reason being that the frontier is temporal: The telephone is no longer the frontier, and in my humble opinion, neither is AI. AI will not take us out of institutional decay, it's arguably part of it.

This brings us to the most important reason why trying to recreate Bell Labs today would be a mistake, which I would like to think about solving in this article: In 2023 we find ourselves in a situation where the brightest young turks struggle to find institutions to support them. William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor, did his doctorate at Caltech and was later recruited by the collaboration of crazy minds and consensus-making machines that was Bell Labs. But had he been born in 1990, he would have either had his spirit crushed in tracked academia, perhaps consumed by the intrinsicalities of quantum gravity, or at best later been fired from Google for having the wrong opinions.

So what is the Bell Labs of 2023? It's important to think about because technological progress is not just about inventing things, it's also about inventing ways of inventing things. If it is not to close as a century defined by stagnation, the 21st century is in dire need of new institutions.

## What Causes Innovation?

> Physical proximity [to the guy who wrote the book] was everything. p.151

Innovation requires organization – of capital, and people.

Organization of capital requires monopoly. See what happened to Bell Labs, only during their monopoly phase were they innovative.

Organization people means physical proximity to geniuses, and this requires prestige to attract those people. It requires telling a bold story that convinces geniuses that this is the most important project in the history of man and will make a shit-ton of money in the case of success. Tell the story that you're just trying to make money and you'll attract rentseekers. Tell the story that you're only doing social justice and you won't have any pull.

Do modern institutions have these things? Capital perhaps, but prestige is dead.

And the guy who wrote the book on circuits, information theory, or electromagnetism, is not nextdoors, but dead. A whole generation of scientists are being bred that conceptualize science not as a process but a body of knowledge.

## The Problems with the Internet

The internet is too big to usually be thought of as a single institution. There are certain characteristics of the internet that generalize, but it's more helpful to think of it as a network of institutions, or a superinstitution. And the institutions that are most important to the internet are the ones that are most under attack: The ones that allow for free speech and free association.

But the problem with the internet is that it's virtual and humans are embodied, we need to interact in physical space to use our full potential. So the internet is not enough, we need to think about institutions in physical space.

Furthermore, Bell Labs was a collaboration between multiple institutions: AT&T, the US military, and academia, however unlike the internet, they were all workking towards a common goal: a cheap telephone, and tangentially, the nuclear bomb.

And if viewed as a single institution, the internet is not a healthy one, as it leads to blob culture. If we were to anthropomorphize it, you could argue its goal is to facilitate the unrestricted flow of information and connectivity.

So what we need is a healthy ecology of institutions that can work towards common goals in physical space.

A personal anecdote will help illustrate the point. Being a college dropout myself I found myself grasping for straws in terms of vital institutions, and I went through the same ones that I would guess the majority of wester 20-somethings turn to today: YouTube, Twitter, Joe Rogan / the podcast space. The problem w platforms like YouTube & Twitter is that they optimize the scroll, not wisdom. They don't have your flourishing as even a secondary incentive. The problem w podcasting is that it creates parasocial relationships. It's not a real relationship, it's a one-way relationship. It's not a community, it's a cult of personality.

These inherent problems of the internet have recently culminated in the "Literally Me" archetype. The archetype includes fictional characters like Rust Cohle in True Detective, Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and William Foster in Falling Down. The archetype's name derives from the fact that so many viewers indeed feel like the character is "literally me."

But what part of the demographic feel like it is "literally them?" It is certainly not your grandparents, it is the 20-something guys who feel betrayed in some way by society. To understand why, it's necessary to understand what the archetype represents. Many of the fictional "literally me" characters are nihilists whilst still being portrayed as "right" in some sense. They are right in the sense that they are pointing out the absurdity of the status quo, and this makes people feel heard. That yes the status quo is absurd, I'm not crazy, it's the institutions that have failed me. I didn't get the same material/economical conditions as my parents and feel frustrated when culture lags and hasn't updated its expectations.

## BUILDINGS

> Kelly considered the design of the building—where research scientists and development engineers from all disciplines were housed together in close proximity—yet another grand Bell Labs invention.

A big reason why tech is stuck is because of remote work. Remote work has been a powerful globalizing force, but let's not confuse quantity for quality – it hasn't led to new innovations.

The "technologists" of our time have recently turned into rentseekers. 90% of SaaS is rentseeking, they're essentially laundrymats, incredibly tracked. As long as we're all interacting through web apps, that's what we'll build. It's like college students who can only come up with business ideas for college students.

### Prestige is Dead

Bell labs engineers were not granted stock options. At Bell Labs, the primary incentives were intellectual freedom, resources, and the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects that could change the world. The prestige of Bell Labs attracted top talent who were driven more by the pursuit of innovation and discovery than financial gain. The opportunity to be in walking distance of "the guy who wrote the book on" any science topic, and in fact encouraged by management to never hesitate going ask these brilliant minds for help. It was a different era and business model, less about quick profits and more about laying the groundwork for entire industries.

Something that's also overlooked are the old-time dynamics of dress-code and cigarette breaks. These might seem like silly, useless relics of the past. People will say smoking is bad, but it's silly to ever consider any habit in isolation. During a cigarette break you often have the most interesting conversations stimulated by nicotine, sunlight and fresh air – much more mindexpanding than sitting alone, hunched over bluelight. And dress-code is a way to signal that what you're working on matters.

## Lone Genius Theory

Although Shannon, inventor of information theory, was a loner, he admits Bell Labs as an institution played a vital role in his research and development – as an intellectual environment, the people, and Bell System's myriad of technical challenges. [7, 42, Liversidge, "Profile of Claude Shannon"]

If our institutions would have been working, they wouldn't have been so occupied with trying to deny lone genius theory, it would have been a non-issue. So it's almost like a tell, because the institutions are halting, they need to defend their existence at the slightest hint of a threat. And because they can't prove themselves with results, they need to deny anyone who tries to exit and try their luck outside the institution.

## The Tech Frontier is Temporal

> So where are the places where technology is happening? Where is there room for the journey to continue?  The frontier is a promising place, but also a very uncertain one. You can imagine a tech market where nothing is happening for a long time, things suddenly start to happen, and then it all stops. The tech frontier is temporal, not geographical. It’s when things are happening.

## The Frontier is Deserted (Non-Competetive)

AI is definitely not the frontier:

> Since the goal is to build companies that will still be around in 2020, you want to avoid a field where things are moving too quickly. You want to avoid being an innovative but non-profitable disk drive company from the ‘80s.
>

> One way to tell whether you’ve found a good frontier is to answer the question “Why should the 20th employee join your company?” If you have a great answer, you’re on the right track. If not, you’re not. The problem is the question is deceptively easy sounding.

All the people going into AI rn fail to understand this point:

> We should ask ourselves whether the right time to enter a tech industry is early on, as conventional wisdom suggests. The best time to enter may be much later than that. It can’t be too late, since you still need room to do something. But you want to enter the field when you can make the last great development, after which the drawbridge goes up and you have permanent capture. You want to pick the right time, go long on tech, succeed, and then short tech.

### Tech is political

Technology is political

Because It either centralises or decentralises power and therefore will threaten governments or individuals 

Bell labs decentralized power with tech such as telephone and radio (momentarily centralized)

Manhattan project centralized power

Urbit decentralises

OpenAI centralizes power

## Preface: Trippleblind

There are two senses in which we as a society are epistemologically blind to the frontier.

The first is eternal to all societies: The frontier is narrative-violating and category-defying. It's unknown unknowns. If there's a buzzword for it, it's definitely not the frontier.

The second is tied to our current society: There's a sense in which the frontier has been stolen. It hasn't, but there's a lot of people who want you to believe the status quo is the best possible world. These people reject not only technological innovation but also traditionalism. They neither want to return nor progress, they want you to use their language and think their thoughts. So this is how you're blinded. The frontier is there, but if you can't see it, step one is to realize you're blind.

## Institutions

You will not find novel ideas in institutions.

What is an institution? The obvious ones are media and state arms. But also be aware of the subtler ones that will claim to be on the side of progress: tech and academia.

You'll find the progress-deniers concentrated to institutions. The first is "tech", which is now a rentseeking industry. The second is academia, which is now a credentialism industry.

The way to break out of the tracks is to reject most institutions, especially academia. There was a time when academia was powerful, e.g. Bell Labs.

### Intelligence is Real, but People Don't Think

Peopl are Outsourceing non-thinking to AI

It's not that AI is intelligent/creative

It's that most what humans do is not intelligent/creative

Realize that "education" is 91% credentialism [1]. University creates an illusion of competancy. Realize half of the time in academia is wasted on admin. But do not let the corruption of academia cause you to overcorrect in the other direction of believing that any attempt at thought is in vain. As a self-learner you can be ~100% more effective with no admin and no vendor lock-in. Realize most people don't learn, the bar to knowing is low. Actually try to learn.

### Institutional lag

Tesla clashed with professors over the practicality of direct current (DC) vs alternating current (AC) electrical systems. He was a strong proponent of AC, while his professors favored DC. This ideological rift was significant, as Tesla later revolutionized electrical systems by successfully implementing AC. The disagreement is a testament to how institutional thinking can sometimes lag behind innovative ideas.

## When did it begin?

Stagnation began in 1950s

Sidetracked by quantum gravity?

Why we find Oppenheimer so invigorating because it reminds us that there used to be a time of excitement

Discovering fission and I nventing the nuke is morally complicated but it is undeniably exciting and undeniably it is technological progress 

Media wants you to believe openai is our ages Manhattan project, but it’s but a shadow

## Frontiers of the Past

Looking back can help us look forward.

### 1/ Bell Labs

A good reminder that idea factories are possible, and history tells us the physical space – the people it gathers and how it organizes them – is important.

The importance of mixing different disciplines, often with tension.

### 2/ Manhattan Project

The Manhattan Project shows us the value of having a domain-literate leader. Oppenheimer was a physicist, and he was able to lead the project because he understood the science. He was able to make decisions and tradeoffs that a non-physicist would not have been able to make.

### 3/ Apple

A healthy reminder of the narrow-mindedness of the Y-Combinator philosophy. Jobs and Woz didn't set up a landing page with an email form and a "sign up" button. They built a computer in a garage.

But Apple didn't rely on an institution as much as Bell Labs or the Manhattan project, which is what makes it such a good role model for our time. It was a company, and it was a company that was able to make huge leaps in technology.

## The Problem with AI

I told my ChatGPT preferences that I'm moderately sceptical to mainstream science, and now it just self-describes its answers as "non-mainstream" lol

## My Map for 2023

What Comes After The Information Age? What does post-Bell-Labian progress look like?

no matter what the deep-state program is, technology is the weapon at your disposal. technology is political and disrupts power structures

### 1/ Post-Einsteinian Physics

Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / study ancient egypt / reverse-engineer UFOs)

RESEARCHERS WANTED: You will be sifting ancient Sumerian texts in university libraries, decoding Egyptian runes, and have months of ontological shock with constant coffee jitters. Return to shared reality doubtful. Immense civilizational and personal wealth in case of success.

### It's not all cultural degeneration

there are also intentional Sidetrackers

Also Electrodynamics (telsa did great progress and then it stopped)

Research Institute of Advanced study.

Sidetrackers after Einstein:
- Wolfgang pauli
- fermi
- dirac
- Wittens

### 2/ Resilient Computing

Holium / Urbit

### 3/ Anti-Fakeness

Zorp / ZK proofs

### 4/ Resilient finance

Bitcoin

### 5/ Healthy Living

Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat)

### 6/ Energy too Cheap to Meter

Nuclear / Cold fusion

## Why Innovate?

There is a plethora of domains in which we're in a local optimum. There has never been a point in history with so much obesity, demensia, and mental illness. Give the market time and it will cheapen alternative food ingredients inflammatory seed oils and high-fructose corn syrup. We can't stop here. We need to innovate.

## Conclusion

Am I romanticising a past I wasn’t in to experience? The counter argument is looking at the outcomes: what inventions did it lead to? What inventions are we producing?

If you seek Assymetrical upside For both society and yourself, live by the mantra: If the whole world is learning how to fight, You should be learning how to dance.

There is no formula for the institutionless? Formula: long substance, short status.

Intelligence is real, people just don't think. So thinking is the remedy to institutional decay.

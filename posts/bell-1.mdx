The Bellian Shipwreck
"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment." - Paul Dirac
Bell Labs was to beurocratoc for Robert, so he left with Shockley to California.
Germanium could not withstand heat (requirement for military applications), so they switched to silicon.
William Shockley left Bell Labs to commercialize the transistor, with Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. But he was an authorative manager, and his employees left to form Fairchild Semiconductor, which in turn spawned Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.
Fairchild Semiconductor was the first example of a Silicon Valley company, and the first to use venture capital. Before that the work culture in America had been to work for a company for life, and the company would take care of you.

Some cursory project ideas:
Post-Einsteinian physics, Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / reverse-engineer UFOs). Probably some value in looking into ancient Egypt. RESEARCHERS WANTED: You will be sifting ancient Sumerian texts in university libraries, decoding Egyptian runes, and have months of ontological shock with constant coffee jitters. Return to shared reality doubtful. Immense civilizational and personal wealth in case of success.
Second is resilient computing and a non-predatory internet. Think Bitcoin / Holium / Urbit / Zorp / ZK proofs.
Third is healthy living and Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat.
Fourth is energy too Cheap to Meter with Nuclear / Cold fusion. Energy is fundamental, if you do not have it, you cannot do anything, or worse, are forced to do things you do not want to do.
Fifth is Consciousness research such as Howard Hughes Medical Institute
Sixth is backing fundamental physics research, such as Jim Simons philantropic efforts.

*Yeah I want money, what you're gonna do about it?*

Ultimately, I don't think we can know why we do things.

Yes, we can state our reasons, and that's nice. But if we're going to convince/delude ourselves and our surroundings, of why we're doing what we're doing, we might as well pick the least flattering explanation.

Because in embracing unsexy motives, such as fame, sex, and power, there's no worry about self-delusion. Dan Bilzerian never has to contemplate his place in the moral hierarchy. It's a form of vulnerability. And then, even if we are still deluding ourselves, it'll at least be in the right direction - and can only get better from there!

Underestimating one's morals can do virtually no harm. Overestimating on the other hand - thinking you're Mother Teresa when you're not...scary business.

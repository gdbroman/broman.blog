"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment." - Paul Dirac

Bell Labs was to beurocratoc for Robert, so he left with Shockley to California.

Germanium couldn't withstand heat (requirement for military applications), so they switched to silicon.

William Shockley left Bell Labs to commercialize the transistor, with Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. But he was an authorative manager, and his employees left to form Fairchild Semiconductor, which in turn spawned Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.

Fairchild Semiconductor was the first example of a Silicon Valley company, and the first to use venture capital. Before that the work culture in America had been to work for a company for life, and the company would take care of you.

At the end of the 20th century, we took some well-deserved time off. The break began physically, with the invention of the atomic bomb, and was concluded virtually, with the booming commercialization of the personal computer. It is common to think of the paralyzing effect these two events have had on megapolitics, but less so what happens to progress itself when you remove the two most powerful, natural motivators for new ideas: violence and boredom. The sabbatical is getting uncomfortably long, and the beginning of the 21st century hints at an empirical answer to the Fermi Paradox; not that civilizations blow themselves up, but that they seduce themselves into retirement. With Soma but a click away, the question becomes not whether we can outdo the 20th century, but whether we can do so without physical war.

Fifty years ago, physicists, engineers, and mathematicians finished a fifty-year sprint that shipped the transistor, the laser, fiber optics, the communication satellite, the telephone, and the UNIX operating system, enabling the move from physical to virtual space. Bell Labs, a spinoff R&D lab of AT&T, and arguably the most successful science and technology project known to history, was able to do this not because its scientists were of different genetic makeup, but because they had access to healthy consensus-making machines, facilitating wide, cross-disciplinary collaboration, fueled in big part by the threat of Germany and the USSR.

In stark contrast, the 21st century starts out distracted. William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor, was born in 1910, did his doctorate at Caltech and was later recruited by the band of pirates that was Bell Labs. But had he been born in 1990, he would have either had his spirit crushed in SAT-prepped academia, perhaps sidetracked by the minutia of quantum gravity, or at best later been fired from Google for his views on race and intelligence. We seem to forget that science is not a body of knowledge, but a process fueled by errors, and that when the frontier is no longer the telephone, it's unwise to exile the very types of minds that could discover teleportation.

Further illustrating the decay of academia, there could be nothing more anachronistic than the opening sequence of the 2001 movie, A Beautiful Mind. The scene is set in 1947, and the protagonist, John Nash, is one of a dozen young mathematicians who have just arrived at Princeton University. The students, all clad in sharlpy tailored suits, are seated in the mathematics department lounge with tobacco smoke in the air and portraits of great thinkers gracing the dark-mahogany walls, receiving the dean's welcoming words:

> Mathematicians won the war. Mathematicians broke the Japanese codes... and built the A-bomb. Mathematicians... like you. The stated goal of the Soviets is global Communism. In medicine or economics, in technology or space, battle lines are being drawn. To triumph, we need results. Publishable, applicable results. Now who among you will be the next Morse? The next Einstein? Who among you will be the vanguard of democracy, freedom, and discovery? Today, we bequeath America's future into your able hands. Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

With government spineless, and academia tracked, today's talent finds itself drawn to more vital institutions like Silicon Valley (which in part provides a sociological explanation of the stagnation of the physical sciences). At one point the valley functioned as renegade haven, but now it's entering a similar stasis like Washington, DC, and Cambridge, MA. Although Big Tech formalized the Bell Labs model, it has been living off of the same set of 50-year old ideas produced by research institutions that are now dead. And while it's possible to reform from the inside, it's at this point more likely that change will come from outside.

## Stuck in Commercialization

If the founding of Bell Labs in 1925 marks the start of a period of research, and Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969 marking the start of a period of development, then the release of Apple II in 1977 marks the peak of Silicon Valley, and the start of a period of commercialization. If it is not to close out as a century defined by globalized rentseeking, the 21st century is in dire need of open research institutions. But technological progress is not just about inventing things, it's also about inventing ways of inventing things.

Google has famously gone above and beyond to copy the Bell Labs model. With its great cash reserves, it has built sprawling campuses and informal office environments aimed at fostering creativity. And they pay high multiples of the market rate for ostensibly the brightest minds. Google even has the 20% rule which encourages employees to spend 20% of their time on side projects not directly related to their main tasks in order to inspire exploration. The 20% rule was directly inspired by Bell Labs philosophy on exploration and has led to some of Google's successful products like Gmail and Google News. But as American mathematician Charles Peirce feared, "I am afraid there will be little tangible left in a later age, to remind our heirs that we were men, rather than cogs in a machine."<sup>1</sup> Like the amateur cyclist with the most expensive glasses and suit, Google has managed to copy Bell Labs in all the ways that don't matter.

The Google engineer is of a different breed than the Bell engineer. Whilst certainly smart, he will not build mechanical maze-solving mice in his spare time, but instead read "The Lean Startup" and practice Leetcode. The Google engineer views work not as honorable, but an extension of school, a continuation of tasks to be done, and a line item on the resume. Pirates aren't bought with a nice boat – they pledge their allegiance to whoever is going out on a great adventure with the slight possibility of loot and glory. And because Google lacks adventure, naturally it attracts maintainers and not pirates.

Another tempting contemporary Bell Labs analogue may be OpenAI. And while it's not yet as tracked as the rest of big tech, it's a closed project of narrower scope. The transistor was a multidisciplinary achievement involving solid state physics, material science, electrical engineering, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. ChatGPT was built using all but one of those disciplines. This is not a competition in what project can invoke the highest number of disciplines. Nor am I questioning the utility of a product like ChatGPT – I am using it to write this very article. And OpenAI might one day create "safe AGI," but the company is not yet as exploding and cross-disciplined of an institution as Bell Labs was.

So where does one go to learn all these disciplines? Out of all of the STEM fields, computer science, a subfield of mathematics, is arguably the easiest to self-study, which in part explains why software has become such a popoular resort for the institutionless and benefited from an explosion in creativity thus. The colleges will deny the effectiveness of self-study no matter the field; that knowledge acquired in one's chamber is somehow inferior to knowledge acquired in a classroom setting. The reactionary view becomes that there is no value whatsoever to communal learning. But as with most extremist positions, they're a tell that both parties are overcompensating. If MOOCs were a sufficient substitute, the dropout would not feel the need to constantly assert it. Likewise, if our institutions would have been working, they wouldn't have been so occupied with trying to deny lone genius theory, it would have been a non-issue. But as a culture we are still overindexed on college, so I will not countersignal the dropout anymore. And because the colleges are halting, they need to defend their existence at the slightest hint of threat. And because they can't deliver the results, they need to deny anyone who tries to exit and try their luck outside the institution.

The most worthy Bell comparison recent in time is Apple. Apple was founded in 1976, and in its first 20 years it completely defined a new era of personal computing and technology business. Apple would not have been able to do this without Steve Jobs' vision. Had he and Woz followed the sort of random-walk advice that Y Combinator spouts, they would have ended up in hardware retail. When Bell Labs was first developing the mobile phone, their marketing study in 1971 concluded that "there was no market for mobile phones at any price." Engel, the head of the cellular system design at Bell, later came to believe that marketing studies could only tell you something about the demand for products that already exist.<sup>2</sup> Steve Jobs had a similar view that people don't know what they want until you show it to them.

YC has produced some of the highest market capitalizations of the 21st century, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. Again I pose the question whether these services have accelerated civilization to the same degree as the transistor? Fundamentally, YC adherents don't believe their brains, or at best they outsource thinking to AI. Instead of envisioning the future they ask the market what it craves and fills that need. "Make something people want" is great business advice, but many times it's a faster horse.

But even Apple was a project of commercialization, Apple didn't make fundamental discoveries, but rather took the ideas of Bell Labs and made them accessible to the masses. And this Sillicon Valley-fication has only gotten worse in the recent decade. The east-coast entrepreneur is too much Edison and not enough Tesla. The old ideas are exhausted, people are overspecialized, research projects are siloed in private companies, and we confuse tech and commercialization. This leaves us with all but one contemporary institution that is imperfect yet has the potential to break through the institutional decay: the internet.

## Getting Back to Reality

The problem with the internet is that it doesn't offer the same adventure as crossing the Atlantic for the first time, or racing against the Sovjets to the atom bomb. In contrast to Bell Labs, the internet isn't teleological. The facilitattion of unrestricted flow of information isn't rooted in a deep need like survival, or virtue like glory. This meaninglessness recently reflects itself in culture with the "Literally Me" meme.

The "Literally Me" meme portrays an archetype represented by fictional characters such as Rust Cohle in True Detective, William Foster in Falling Down, and Tyler Durden in Fight Club. The archetype's name derives from the fact that so many viewers indeed feel like the character is literally them. And it is certainly not your grandparents, it is frustrated 20-plus guys who feel betrayed by society. Many of the fictional "literally me" characters are nihilists whilst still being portrayed as being "right" in some sense. They are right in the sense that they are pointing out the absurdity and disappointment of the status quo, and this makes people feel heard. Young men used to be able to exercise their adventourous spirit in war or sailing the seas, or satiate their intellectual hunger in academia. But now all the seas are explored, the wars are fake, and a degree is more degrading than it is intellectually stimulating. The litterally me phenomenon represents the frustration of having these natural instincts denied.

But we cannot escape up in the cloud, as that too would deny human nature, of being embodied. Contrary to what many propagated during the remote-boom of 2021, new ideas is slower in virtual space, humans need to interact in physical space to feel alive and use our fullest potential. And while it is true that the logic of violence has changed and the wars of today are informational, TikTok is too abstract to be a comparable enemy to the USSR. So the internet is not enough, but luckily there's a solution.

The network state, originally conceptualized by James Dale Davidson, and recently popularized by Balaji Srinivasan, is about embodying value-driven online communities in physical space, and it's how you solve the internet's denial of nature. Bu the network state should not bee seen as an end in and of itself, whether political or spiritual, much more interesting is to view it as a new form of institution, a tool that can facilitate new ideas. As a bonus, real new ideas, is the most powerful way of surpassing legacy nation's GDP and thus achieving recognition as a sovereign state. The network State is a tool for new ideas, and new ideas is a tool for sovereignty. Viewing the network state merely as a solution to regulation or political inertia is not enough, it has been tried.<sup>3</sup> Instead it needs to be treated as a return to human nature by heeding the instinctive call to adventure.

With the network state as a vehicle it could provide the same type of breathing room that's required for blue-sky research, as federal funding. The Limits of Venture Capital is that it can't fund research experiments. And with the right constitution, it could provide the same type of motivation as war, but without the violence.

Populus matters. The turn-around scientists of the 21st century will be dropouts and excommunicados. The individual needs to be green enough that they haven't been indoctrinated into the current paradigm. It can't just be, think of the wackiest ideas you can imagine, then you get Jason Reza Jorjani. It needs to be motivated by necessity, not just a desire to be fringe. That necessity can be life or death (war), or spiritual life or death (virtue)

Honour is the instinctive sense in which Bell Labs feels anachronistic. The surface-level explanation is the old school dress code, and the frequent cigaratte breaks. Both overlooked practices that contribute to a culture of seriousness and socialization. The deeper explanation is that Honour is dead. Bell labs engineers were not granted stock options. At Bell Labs, the primary incentives were intellectual freedom, resources, and the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects that could change the world. Adventure. The honour of working at Bell Labs attracted top talent who were driven more by the pursuit of new ideas and discovery than financial gain. The opportunity to be in walking distance of "the guy who wrote the book on" any science topic, and in fact encouraged by management to never hesitate going asking these brilliant minds for help. It was a different era and business model, less about quick profits and more about laying the groundwork for western civilization.

Furthermore, organization of people. As [] said: "Physical proximity [to the guy who wrote the book] was everything" (p.151). Not only do you need honour to attract geniuses, you need them in physical proximity to each other. One of the most important factors in science is the spontaneous sharing of ideas. "Kelly considered the design of the building—where research scientists and development engineers from all disciplines were housed together in close proximity—yet another grand Bell Labs invention." Now the guy who wrote the book on circuits, information theory, or electromagnetism, is not next door, but dead. It's a big reason why tech is stuck. Remote work has been a powerful globalizing force, but let's not confuse quantity for quality – it hasn't led to new ideas. The "technologists" of our time have recently turned into rentseekers. 90% of SaaS is rentseeking, they're essentially laundrymats, almost fully formulized. As long as we're all interacting through web apps, that's what we'll build. It's like college students who can only come up with business ideas for college students. All of tech is converging towards the same level of sophistication as a laundrymat.

## Some Cursory Ideas

Post-Einsteinian physics, Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / reverse-engineer UFOs). Probably some value in looking into ancient Egypt. RESEARCHERS WANTED: You will be sifting ancient Sumerian texts in university libraries, decoding Egyptian runes, and have months of ontological shock with constant coffee jitters. Return to shared reality doubtful. Immense civilizational and personal wealth in case of success.

Second is resilient computing and a non-predatory internet. Think Bitcoin / Holium / Urbit / Zorp / ZK proofs.

Third is healthy living and Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat.

Fourth is energy too Cheap to Meter with Nuclear / Cold fusion. Energy is fundamental, if you don't have it, you can't do anything, or worse, are forced to do things you don't want to do.

Fifth is Consciousness research such as Howard Hughes Medical Institute

Sixth is backing fundamental physics research, such as Jim Simons philantropic efforts.

Seventh is expeditions. Expeditions is a way to create a strong culture and attract talent. Would probably be employed as a program of the network state.

## Conclusion

No matter the conspiratorial programs, and I am not ruling out their existence, there will always be some wiggle room, and with the network state as the replacement institution, technology is once again the weapon at your disposal. Technology is political and disrupts power structures. “There is no need to fear or to hope, but only to look for new weapons.” <sup>4</sup>

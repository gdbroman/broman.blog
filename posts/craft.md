Yesterday night I wrote in my journal...

I think I can finally see myself working with software for a big part of my life.

Finally gained enough mastery to confidently be willing to dedicate myself to this craft.

Don’t know how many hours I’ve racked up programming, but it’s a sizeable amount at this point.

It feels amazing, to *possess a skill*, you know? 

Having a craft is like a safe space from chaos: Where you don't feel like an impostor; where you get to experience, the otherwise rare joy of, having control. It's a cheat code, because no matter what life throws at you, this corner of order will always be there for you. And I think it adds to your character.

Craftsmen are interesting people.

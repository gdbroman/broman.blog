We want to be seen _doing_ the thing, _wanting_ the thing, or _not wanting_ the thing.

Also not caring about signaling is a form of signaling. Inescapably! all we do is signal.

How many layers of meta-cognition would you like to obscure it with? This freedom we have.

But above all, we seek unconditional love - especially those obscuring their signal. So really, Love is our Freedom.

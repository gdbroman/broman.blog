We head to work like we've never heard of sex, sadness, or shitting. All neocortex, survival but a story. Not afraid, never confused. Not secretly dying to know whether everyone else is simply faking it. No sir.

Industrial society has taken on a life of its own that can only be appropriately described as parasitism. We're embarrassed by our own condition and look up to technology because it's clean and predictable. It's made us adopt its goals in preference to our own. Technology's our god and the robot our hero: does exactly what it's told, without complications.

We're messy, vulnerable creatures. But as much as we'd like to, our true nature cannot be overridden after a mere couple of hundred years. Being human is embarrassingâ€”but only if we suppress it. Embracing it, one finds real beauty in it.

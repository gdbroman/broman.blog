Not to take unnecessary risk, but risk nonetheless. To live not merely survive.

The quickest way out of despair is doing something dangerous. Or scary. As long as the brain interprets danger, it seems to do the trick.

Spontaneous travel, quitting the safe job, voluntarily facing embarassment. Adventuring. Safety implying unrealization.

And pondering scary undertakings, we always conclude the worst-case better than the amygdala's stories. Suffering only in imagination, a calm mind has little to fear.

Speak absolutely in the abstract, all else is cowardice.

Open-minded is not the same as spineless. Rather be proven wrong than not at all.

Not hedging your opinions is also more fun. Comedians are well aware of this, and some use it as a gimmick. For instance, everyone gets that Bill Burr is not _actually_ misogynistic when he shits on feminism or whatever.

Nuance is boring and unnecessary. People who use _“some,”_ _“maybe”,_ and _“potentially,”_ in each sentence and preamble their opinions with _"it seems like,"_ or _"my current mental model for this is,"_ are just boring to be around. It’s already implied that you’re open to being proven wrong if you’re a decent human being. If we’re always hedging what we’re saying we’re never really saying anything.

And when unsure of how to feel about something, always go where you’re the least expected. Go into spaces you shouldn’t go into. Be the master. Seek the weird, bizarre and esoteric. Going against the crowd makes for more interesting living.

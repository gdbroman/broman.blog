> Inventing the future isn't just a matter of inventing things, it also entails inventing ways to invent those things. p.152

Physicists, engineers, and mathematicians in the 20th century were able to make huge leaps in science and technology. They were able to do this because they had access to healthy consensus-making machines (institutions).

Bell Labs was a collaboration between AT&T and Western Electric. It was a research and development lab that produced some of the most important inventions of the 20th century, including the transistor, the laser, and the UNIX operating system.

AT&T was a public company, but it was a monopoly. It was regulated by the government, and it was required to provide universal service. It was also required to license its patents to anyone who wanted to use them.

In a sense the project was almost governmental when comparing to modern "tech" companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies are private, and they are not regulated by the government. They are also not required to license their patents to anyone who wants to use them.

## Lone Genius Theory

> Physical proximity [to the guy who wrote the book] was everything. p.151

Although Shannon, inventor of information theory, was a loner, he admits Bell Labs as an institution played a vital role in his research and development – as an intellectual environment, the people, and Bell System's myriad of technical challenges. [7, 42, Liversidge, "Profile of Claude Shannon"]

If our institutions would have been working, they wouldn't have been so occupied with trying to deny lone genius theory, it would have been an uninsteresting question. But because the institutions are halting, they need to defend their existence. And because they can't prove themselves through action, they need to deny anyone who tries to exit and try their outside the institution.

## The Bell Labs of 2023

While Bell Labs is technically still around as a part of Nokia, it is but a shadow of its former self. World war 2-era Bell Labs gave birth to the transistor, the laser, the UNIX operating system, and nine Nobel prizes.

If the Manhattan Project was closed-source, could you say Bell Labs was open-source?

One could suggest OpenAI, I think it's closer to the manhattan project, since it's a closed project and small in scope. It's not an exploding idea factory like Bell Labs was.

### Tech is political

Technology is political

Because It either centralises or decentralises power and therefore will threaten governments or individuals 

Bell labs decentralized power with tech such as telephone and radio (momentarily centralized)

Manhattan project centralized power

Urbit decentralises

OpenAI centralizes power

## Preface: Trippleblind

There are two senses in which we as a society are epistemologically blind to the frontier.

The first is eternal to all societies: The frontier is narrative-violating and category-defying. It's unknown unknowns. If there's a buzzword for it, it's definitely not the frontier.

The second is tied to our current society: There's a sense in which the frontier has been stolen. It hasn't, but there's a lot of people who want you to believe the status quo is the best possible world. These people reject not only technological innovation but also traditionalism. They neither want to return nor progress, they want you to use their language and think their thoughts. So this is how you're blinded. The frontier is there, but if you can't see it, step one is to realize you're blind.

## Institutions

You will not find novel ideas in institutions.

What is an institution? The obvious ones are media and the state. But also be aware of the subtler ones that will claim to be on the side of progress: tech and academia.

You'll find the progress-deniers concentrated to institutions. The first is "tech", which is now a rentseeking industry. The second is academia, which is now a credentialism industry.

The third, and most dangerous, is tied to both our time and the tech space: The "technologists" of our time have recently turned into rentseekers. 90% of SaaS is rentseeking, they're essentially laundrymats, incredibly tracked. E.g. healthcare sucks. Not because of admin, but because there are too many patients. Problems are not attacked at their root.

The way to break out of the tracks is to reject most institutions, especially academia. There was a time when academia was powerful, e.g. Bell Labs.

But today you must realize that most "education" is "credentialism" (90% – see PT vid). University creates an illusion of competancy. Realize half of the time in academia is wasted on admin. As a self-learner you can be ~100% more effective with no admin and no vendor lock-in. Realize most people don't learn, the bar to knowing is low. Actually try to learn.

### Institutional lag

Tesla clashed with professors over the practicality of direct current (DC) vs alternating current (AC) electrical systems. He was a strong proponent of AC, while his professors favored DC. This ideological rift was significant, as Tesla later revolutionized electrical systems by successfully implementing AC. The disagreement is a testament to how institutional thinking can sometimes lag behind innovative ideas.

## Frontiers of the Past

Looking back can help us look forward.

### 1/ Bell Labs

A good reminder that idea factories are possible, and history tells us the physical space – the people it gathers and how it organizes them – is important.

The importance of mixing different disciplines, often with tension.

### 2/ Manhattan Project

The Manhattan Project shows us the value of having a domain-literate leader. Oppenheimer was a physicist, and he was able to lead the project because he understood the science. He was able to make decisions and tradeoffs that a non-physicist would not have been able to make.

### 3/ Apple

A healthy reminder of the narrow-mindedness of the Y-Combinator philosophy. Jobs and Woz didn't set up a landing page with an email form and a "sign up" button. They built a computer in a garage.

## The Problem with AI

I told my ChatGPT preferences that I'm moderately sceptical to mainstream science, and now it just self-describes its answers as "non-mainstream" lol

## My Map for 2023

### 1/ Post-Einsteinian Physics

Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / study ancient egypt)

### 2/ Resilient Computing

Holium / Urbit

### 3/ Anti-Fakeness

Zorp / ZK proofs

### 4/ Resilient finance

Bitcoin

### 5/ Healthy Living

Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat)

### 6/ Energy too Cheap to Meter

Nuclear / Cold fusion

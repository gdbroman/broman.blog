In the previous post, we concluded The Network State to be an escape pod. But it's just a vehicle, and we need a destination. The Network State is a tool, and we need to know what to build with it, and in what order.

## Resilient, Non-Predatory Computing

PILLAR 1: Getting back to the computer as a bicycle for the mind (Non-Predatory Computing). Like a fatty trynna loose weight, frist stop the cookie intake.

resilient computing and a non-predatory internet. Think Bitcoin / Holium / Urbit / Zorp / ZK proofs.

- Blockchain & cryptocurrencies can aid the decentralization of power and foster independent thinking.
- VR games & media for induced awakening experiences. Consciousness tech is basically as old as we are (rituals, mind-altering substances, etc.) but there is likely plenty of unexplored territory using modern hardware and software.

## Basic Science

PILLAR 2: Getting back to the basics of science, away from textbook sceience (reference the structure of scientific revolutions). With mind-bicycles as a tool, we can do this.

Post-Einsteinian physics, Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / reverse-engineer UFOs). Probably some value in looking into ancient Egypt. RESEARCHERS WANTED: You will be sifting ancient Sumerian texts in university libraries, decoding Egyptian runes, and have months of ontological shock with constant coffee jitters. Return to shared reality doubtful. Immense civilizational and personal wealth in case of success.

CTMU / TOE attempts

Healthy living and Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat.

Energy too Cheap to Meter with Nuclear / Cold fusion. Energy is fundamental, if you do not have it, you cannot do anything, or worse, are forced to do things you do not want to do.

Consciousness research such as Howard Hughes Medical Institute

Funding fundamental physics research, such as Jim Simons philantropic efforts.


## Expiditions

> for those who are willing to learn about lock picking or forging shooting permits … for those who have a sense of poetry. For those who are pilgrims.

PILLAR 3: Bonding in the real world, creating a culture where new ideas can be born.

Meetups & gatherings of enlightened individuals (good things happen when conscious people get together—if not only to help others on the path).

Courses & workshops on meditation, yoga, and similar practices. Volunteer or donate to centers. Make initiatives at your workplace, university, community, etc.

High-quality art & integrous intellectual work: Ideas change the world, and beauty will save it!

In the previous post, we concluded The Network State to be an escape pod. But it's just a vehicle, and we need a destination. The Network State is a tool, and we need to know what to build with it, and in what order.

The Bellian Shipwreck
"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment." - Paul Dirac
Bell Labs was to beurocratoc for Robert, so he left with Shockley to California.
Germanium could not withstand heat (requirement for military applications), so they switched to silicon.
William Shockley left Bell Labs to commercialize the transistor, with Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. But he was an authorative manager, and his employees left to form Fairchild Semiconductor, which in turn spawned Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.
Fairchild Semiconductor was the first example of a Silicon Valley company, and the first to use venture capital. Before that the work culture in America had been to work for a company for life, and the company would take care of you.

PILLAR 1: Getting back to the computer as a bicycle for the mind (Non-Predatory Computing). Like a fatty trynna loose weight, frist stop the cookie intake.

PILLAR 2: Getting back to the basics of science, away from textbook sceience (reference the structure of scientific revolutions). With mind-bicycles as a tool, we can do this.

PILLAR 3: Bonding in the real world, creating a culture where new ideas can be born.

Some cursory project ideas:
Post-Einsteinian physics, Interstellar travel (Eric Weinstein non-chem rockets / reverse-engineer UFOs). Probably some value in looking into ancient Egypt. RESEARCHERS WANTED: You will be sifting ancient Sumerian texts in university libraries, decoding Egyptian runes, and have months of ontological shock with constant coffee jitters. Return to shared reality doubtful. Immense civilizational and personal wealth in case of success.

Second is resilient computing and a non-predatory internet. Think Bitcoin / Holium / Urbit / Zorp / ZK proofs.

CTMU / TOE attempts

Third is healthy living and Jack Kruse decen science/cities / Ray Peat.

Fourth is energy too Cheap to Meter with Nuclear / Cold fusion. Energy is fundamental, if you do not have it, you cannot do anything, or worse, are forced to do things you do not want to do.

Fifth is Consciousness research such as Howard Hughes Medical Institute

Sixth is backing fundamental physics research, such as Jim Simons philantropic efforts.

- Blockchain & cryptocurrencies can aid the decentralization of power and foster independent thinking.
- VR games & media for induced awakening experiences. Consciousness tech is basically as old as we are (rituals, mind-altering substances, etc.) but there is likely plenty of unexplored territory using modern hardware and software.
- Meetups & gatherings of enlightened individuals (good things happen when conscious people get together—if not only to help others on the path).
- Psychedelics R&D, including funding and legislation.
- Courses & workshops on meditation, yoga, and similar practices. Volunteer or donate to centers. Make initiatives at your workplace, university, community, etc.
- High-quality art & integrous intellectual work: Ideas change the world, and beauty will save it!

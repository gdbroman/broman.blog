Perfection being the enemy is such a clich√©.

But no matter how many times we hear it, I think everyone has to go through their unique journey of internalization.

It is not a matter of winning or losing. I never _defeat_ resistance. I notice it - _feel_ it - then show up anyway. Partly, I think, because one realizes that our highest selves reside in a place of authenticity.

Being human is rough but rawness allows us to connect. Perfection is about removing flaws; art is about opening up.

We head to work, acting as if we've never heard of sex, sadness, or shitting.

As if we're all neocortex, not deeply driven by survival. As if we're not scared it could all end at any moment - confused as to what we're supposed to do about it? As if, not secretly afraid we're the only ones experiencing this shitshow - or if everyone else is simply hiding it?

We're embarrassed by our own condition and look up to technology because it's clean and predictable.

Industrial society has taken on a life of its own, that can only be appropriately described as parasitism. It's made us adopt its goals in preference to our own.

Technology's our god and the robot our hero: does exactly what it's told, without complications.

We're messy, vulnerable creatures. But as much as we'd like to, our true nature cannot be overridden after a mere couple of hundred years.

Being human is embarrassing - but only if we suppress it. Embracing it, one finds real beauty in it.

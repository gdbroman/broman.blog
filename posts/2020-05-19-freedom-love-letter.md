It is the most precious gift.

The most important right.

The greatest teacher and great equalizer.

Conversely, the worst of crimes is to rob a human of freedom.

Especially, in the name of its antithesis, ‘safety’.

Whether economical, physical or mental - it makes no difference.

Safety destroys the human spirit.

It lures you in with the promise of comfort.

But do not let yourself be fooled.

As soon as it has you reeled in, it'll beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it.

_“The devil does not come dressed in a red cape and pointy horns. He comes as everything you’ve ever wished for”._ [1]

Sadly, those once captured by safety seldom break free.

It is the ultimate Faustian bargain.

The most dangerous deceiver and destroyer of potential.

Courage is our weapon.

With courage we can fight off comfort in the pursuit of freedom.

With courage we can dare to voyage.

To tread the harder path.

Because the alternative is worse.

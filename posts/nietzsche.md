> I teach mankind a new will: to desire this path that men
have followed blindly, and to call it good and no more to
creep aside from it, like the sick and dying!
>
> <cite>—Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>

The Tech Bro needs an ethic. Cold showers and EA: this can't do. Christianity suffers the same problem. An unbalanced view, it won't hold through. A disregard, or naive misunderstanding. An incomplete reading of man.

## Descend

Human has two sides; one bad, one good. Without the one, you won't come far. Together they need to dance. Remember the eagle with the serpent around its neck. We must do shadow work. The tallest trees have the deepest roots.

> It was the sick and dying who despised the body and the earth and invented the things of heaven and the redeeming
drops of blood: but even these sweet and dismal poisons they took from the body and the earth!
>

Don't suppress the antichrist or write it off as simply a product of the devil. The fourth part of God is evil.

## Where We Are

> Our civilization is unwell. We eat food that kills us, we’ve lost sight of beauty, and we neglect our spiritual lives. The world is deranged and decayed, and this frightens people. We don’t look up from our screens; we seek to live within them. 

Modern world sick. Rehash movies and tv series that make you smooth brain. No one has the attention span to read or write. Food numbs you even more. Safety takes away your edge. We stay inside. The five s-devils: High fructose corn syrup, seed oils, starch, soy, sodium. Endless “entertainment.“ Infinite feeds. We deserve better. We need better.

## The Way Forward

A better world is possible.

> Our ultimate goal is to bring about a more vital future for humanity, and we will use technology to achieve this righteous end.

> - Praxis

### The Path is Made by Walking

No one will unshackle you. You need to start walking.

> Untroubled, scornful, outrageous - that is how wisdom wants us to be: she is a woman and never loves anyone but a warrior.
>

The answer is not meditating. The answer is not hustling. The answer is not book cope. The answer is anti-mimetic. Going off-road: The answer is art.

- Zoroastrianism

Health, vitality, and the furtherance of life. It seems like another product or piece of software will only take you that far. In order to really make progress with regards to this, an entirely new system is needed. A new paradise.

## The weight of existence

Low level refrigerator drum that makes you wanna take a hit

## The Relief of Exhalation

You can love the world whilst pointing out its problems. In fact, if you need to lie to yourself about it, do you really love it?

## The Potential of the Coming Century

Is in recognizing

- what we are
- why we're here

What are you beyond?

## The mad man

"They've done it themselves and yet they know not what they do"

Who seeks god only when it suits him won’t be answered

I am sorry.

Help me God. Will you?

These urges to set it all on fire. Are they shouts for something real?

What if we increased our attention spans.

So we’re over here trynna solve problems and then a new guy comes over and start talking with these new words and we’re like wow those are new words what do they mean and trynna figure out if they make sense if they can help solve our problems that we’re trynna solve over here or if he’s just using those words to get the status of smart by pretending to trynna help us out.

What do I want really?

Sunlight. A girl. Friends to see. Is this all.

The less I have of these the more I think I need God.

What if I were smiling?

Has he got lost or hiding? Has he gone on a voyage?

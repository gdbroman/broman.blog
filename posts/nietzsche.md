> I teach mankind a new will: to desire this path that men
have followed blindly, and to call it good and no more to
creep aside from it, like the sick and dying!
>
> <cite>—Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>

The Tech Bro needs an ethic. Cold showers and EA: this can't do. Christianity suffers the same problem. An unbalanced view, it won't hold through. A disregard, or naive misunderstanding. An incomplete reading of man.

## Descend

Human has two sides; one bad, one good. Without the one, you won't come far. Together they need to dance. Remember the eagle with the serpent around its neck. We must do shadow work. The tallest trees have the deepest roots.

> It was the sick and dying who despised the body and the earth and invented the things of heaven and the redeeming
drops of blood: but even these sweet and dismal poisons they took from the body and the earth!
>

Don't suppress the antichrist. The fourth part of God is evil.

## Where We Are

Modern world sick. Rehash movies and tv series that make you smooth brain. No one has the attention span to read or write. Food numbs you even more. Safety takes away your edge. We stay inside. The five devilish esses: High fructose corn syrup, seed oils, starch, soy, sodium. Endless “entertainment.“ Infinite feeds.

An unhealthy body is the result of a mind in distress: a troubled mind.

### The city problem

> Big cities are leftover baggage from the industrial era.
>
> —George Gilder

The state takes your natural birth rights and sells them back to you.

We’re meant to be in nature outside but forced inside if you have any inudustrious drive. Are you engaged? It is harder in city.

We deserve better. We need better.

#### Leave ur tribe

At least If you wanna create something new.

### Classes

- the masses: numb me daddy. give me endless autoscrolling news feed. supersize, starch, sugar, seedoil, sodium. numb me now. yes I'm a bad boy, don't let me think. put dopamine chord inside cranium. Blindfold me, choke me already, put a mask on my face, don't let me outside my cage. High fructose corn syrup. Tell me what to do tell me what to think.
- the elite: disconnected from God, autistic, can't feel. only derives pleasure from dominance.
- the upcomers: can somewhat see through the culture and how the masses are being hypnotized. some become eremites, the rest reach for the top as an only out, therefore justifying what the elite is doing via survival-rationalization. some are good however and believe a turnaround is possible.

### Levels of engagement in the cultural unfoldment

Npc: consuming

Creating: innovators tech and art

Meta noticoor: only analyses doesn’t participate ironically that is a form of participation 

Surfer: realises you can’t step away, does a bit of both

## The Way Forward

At this point you stop asking for reform and begin anew.

Let's stop rearrangin those deck chairs (apps) when the titanic is sinking.

A better world is possible.

Let's neglect our spiritiality no more.

Let us stop hiding from God.

The founding fathers acknowledged that yes we need religious freedom, but nonetheless we need a religious people. Everyone needs transcendent values. Something to bind them, other than their own self interest.

### The Path is Made by Walking

> You showed up. You're here, that's enough.
> It won't be enough forever but tonight it is.
> Right now it's everything.

No one will unshackle us. We need to start walking.

> Untroubled, scornful, outrageous - that is how wisdom wants us to be: she is a woman and never loves anyone but a warrior.
>

The answer is not meditating. The answer is not hustling. The answer is not book cope. The answer is anti-mimetic. Going off-road: The answer is art.

- Zoroastrianism

Health, vitality, and the furtherance of life. It seems like another product or piece of software will only take you that far. In order to really make progress with regards to this, an entirely new system is needed. A new paradise.

## The weight of existence

Low level refrigerator drum that makes you wanna take a hit.

The satanic entertainment system is pulling your attention away from how simple things are.

Reclaim mental bandwidth.

## The Relief of Exhalation

You can love the world whilst pointing out its problems. In fact, if you need to lie to yourself about it, do you really love it?

## The Potential of the Coming Century

Is in recognizing

- what we are
- why we're here

What are you beyond?

## The mad man (do I have it in me?)

"They've done it themselves and yet they know not what they do"

Who seeks god only when it suits him won’t be answered

I am sorry.

Help me God. Will you?

These urges to set it all on fire. Are they shouts for something real?

What if we increased our attention spans.

So we over here trynna solve problem and then new guy come over start talking with these new words and we like wow those new words what do they mean and trynna figure out if they make sense if they can help solve problem that we trynna solve over here or if he just using new words to get the status of smart by pretending to trynna help out?

What do I want really?

Sunlight. A girl. Friends to see. Is this all.

The less I have of these the more I think I need God.

What if I were smiling?

Has he got lost or hiding? Has he gone on a voyage?

---

The modern idea of one idea per essay (or book even!) is sterile.

Do you resonate with life or death?

Throw as many ideas together you can fit. Melting pot boom vitality.

## notes on nietzsche

The atheists like to claim him theirs, but N is far from someone who was against religion/spirituality

He was just against the kind of Christians he saw around him

He was against values that “devalue themselves”

Amor fati = becoming what you are

Not appeal to emotion? Pah. What else to appeal to?

> “I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.”

><cite>—Jack London</cite>

Nietzsche predicted that when we no longer have transcendental values to bound ourselves to, we will become what he called "the last man." Pityable, nihilistic bugmen only concerned with avoiding pain and increasing pleasure. Never questioning, completely detached from the bigger picture. Completely detached. Unfortunately, Nietzsche's prediction has come to fruition.

> I teach mankind a new will: to desire this path that men
have followed blindly, and to call it good and no more to
creep aside from it, like the sick and dying!

> <cite>—Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>

Modern world sick.

Forget about DAOs.. not about seasteading.

In the last 20 pages of <i>The Sovereign Individual</i>, we find the book's real idea: Tech Bro needs an ethic.

Cold showers and EA: this can't do. An unbalanced view, won't hold through. Will you stop hiding from God? And I, meglect my spirit no more?

The founding fathers acknowledged: freedom—and religious such, yes—but a religious people, we need nonetheless. Transcendental values. Something to hold on to, other than our own self-interest.

A better world is possible. For some, this Religion. And contrarians, perhaps some form of Prometheism? Bottom line is: The potential of our century lies in recognizing what we are, and why we are here. What are you beyond? Do you resonate with life or death? Vitalism or safety? The path is made by walking.

## The Path

The first step would be to end the book cope. Put down the book. A true ubermensch would not look to prestigious thinkers like Nietzsche, but to go inwards.

## Descend

Human has two sides. Without the one, you won't come far. Together we dance. Remember the eagle with the serpent around its neck. We must do shadow work. The tallest trees have the deepest roots.

> It was the sick and dying who despised the body and the earth and invented the things of heaven and the redeeming
drops of blood: but even these sweet and dismal poisons they took from the body and the earth!
>

Don't suppress the antichrist. The fourth part of God is evil.

## Where We Are

Modern world sick. Rehash movies and tv series that make you smooth brain. No one has the attention span to read or write. Food numbs. Safety steals my edge. We stay inside. The five devilish esses: High fructose corn syrup, seed oils, starch, soy, sodium. Endless “entertainment.“ Infinite feeds. An unhealthy body, a mind in distress. The weight of existence. Low level refrigerator drum that makes you wanna take a hit. The satanic entertainment system is pulling your attention away from how simple things can be (are). Reclaim mental bandwidth. What if we increased our attention spans.

### The city problem

Are we gonna look back at cities like some barbarian relic from the past? "Look we used to live like ants!"

The state takes your natural birth rights and sells them back to you.

We’re meant to be in nature outside but forced inside if you have any inudustrious drive. Are you engaged? It is harder in city.

We deserve better. We need better.

### Classes

- the masses (consumtariat): numb me daddy. give me endless autoscrolling news feed. supersize, starch, sugar, seedoil, sodium. numb me now. yes I'm a bad boy, don't let me think. put dopamine cord inside cranium. Blindfold me, choke me already, put a mask on my face, don't let me outside my cage. High fructose corn syrup. Tell me what to do tell me what to think.
- the elite: disconnected from God, autistic, can't feel. only derives pleasure from dominance.
- the upcomers: can somewhat see through the culture and how the masses are being hypnotized. some become eremites, the rest reach for the top as an only out, therefore justifying what the elite is doing via survival-rationalization. some are good however and believe a turnaround is possible.

The state takes your natural birth rights and sells them back to you.

Meant to be in nature. Forced inside if you have any inudustrious drive.

Leave ur tribe if you wanna create something new.

### Classes (Levels of engagement in the cultural unfoldment)

- the masses: numb me daddy. (endless autoscrolling news feed. supersize, starch, sugar, seedoil, sodium. numb me now. yes I'm a bad boy, don't let me think. put dopamine chord inside cranium. Blindfold me, choke me already, put a mask on my face, don't let me outside my cage. High fructose corn syrup. Tell me what to do tell me what to think.)
- the elite: disconnected from God (autistic, can't feel. only derives pleasure from dominance.)
- the upcomers: can somewhat see through culture and how the mass formation. some become eremites, some join the elite, rationalizating it as a survival mechanism. some become meta noticoors and only analyse, doesn’t participate, ironically that is a form of participation. some surfers: realises you can’t step away, does a bit of both. some are good and believe in turnaround.

## The Way Forward

At what point do you begin anew?

Let's stop rearrangin those deck chairs (apps) when the titanic is sinking.

A better world is possible.

Let's stop hiding from God: neglect our spiritiality no more.

The founding fathers acknowledged that yes we need religious freedom, but nonetheless we need a religious people. Everyone needs transcendent values. Something to bind them, other than their own self-interest.

### The Path is Made by Walking

> You showed up. You're here, that's enough.
> It won't be enough forever but tonight it is.
> Right now it's everything.

No one will unshackle us. We need to start walking.

The answer is not meditating. The answer is not hustling. The answer is not book cope. The answer is anti-mimetic. Going off-road: The answer is art. In whatever you do. Now read, work, meditate, etc. It's how you do it.

> Untroubled, scornful, outrageous - that is how wisdom wants us to be: she is a woman and never loves anyone but a warrior.

- Zoroastrianism

Health, vitality, and the furtherance of life. It seems like another product or piece of software will only take you that far. In order to really make progress with regards to this, an entirely new system is needed. A new paradise.

## The Relief of Exhalation (The Potential of the Coming Century)

Is in recognizing

- what we are
- why we're here

What are you beyond?

You can love the world whilst pointing out its problems. In fact, if you need to lie to yourself about it, do you really love it?

## The mad man (do I have it in me?)

"They've done it themselves and yet they know not what they do"

Who seeks god only when it suits him won’t be answered

I am sorry.

Help me God. Will you?

These urges to set it all on fire. Shouts. For something real?

So we over here trynna solve problem and then new guy come over start talking with these new words and we like wow those new words what do they mean and trynna figure out if they make sense if they can help solve problem that we trynna solve over here or if he just using new words to get the status of smart by pretending to trynna help out?

What do I want really?

Sunlight. A girl. Friends to see. Is this all.

The less I have of these the more I think I need God.

I would rather suffer and be in your bosom than happy and not know you.

Suffering reminds me of You.

Has he got lost or hiding? Is he on voyage?

What if I were smiling?

## P. S. Note

The modern idea of one idea per essay (or book even!) is sterile.

Do you resonate with life or death?

Throw as many ideas together you can fit. Melting pot boom vitality.

## notes on nietzsche

The atheists like to claim him theirs, but N is far from someone who was against religion/spirituality

He was just against the kind of Christians he saw around him

He was against values that “devalue themselves”

Amor fati = becoming what you are

Not appeal to emotion? Pah. What else to appeal to?

## mass(k) conformity

There are many ways in which physical conformity is more dangerous than confirmity of thought alone.

Physical conformity, such as waring masks, is visual and therefore much stronger. The inertia is gonna be bigger since everywhere you look it's gonna seem like people share the same view. At least when there's conformity of thought you can hold your stance silently. In physical conformity there is nowhere to hide. If you try to hold your stance you'll suffer consequences. Also, complying physically will disenfranchise you on a much deeper level than merely "hiding in your head," since it requires you to actively and continuously give up a part of you.

Even people who dislike mask mandates—who wear them just out of fear for confrontation, or for suffering personal consequences (a very strong incentive indeed)—you won't know what percentage they are. What percentage aren't willing to share their actual view, even if you ask them? This is terrifying. You have to press them on this. Because after a while of silence, soon they too won't be so sure of their view anymore.

Sure you can always move out to the countryside. But at what cost. We are supposed to be in nature but we're also supposed to be together. Why is my species going mad, we're social creatures damnit.

What's your soul worth, anon?

Do you want snacks or skills?

If Software Engineer at MANGA is peak competition,

## Avoid Tracks

I have not worked for MANGA. But the fact that there is a booming industry for cracking the Coding Interview™ should be an obvious tell. It's no place you want to be. Grinding LeetCode is like SAT prep; a safe track if you can compete. But it is a *track*: It will narrow your vision, and it lacks asymmetric upside.

## Be a Curious Grug

Petroleum engineering is asymmetric, but perhaps not too exciting. *What future do YOU want to bring to be?*

(Think hard about the future.)

To find existing efforts, look for the strange and esoteric. Even better, *what does the mainstream condemn?* Paths with asymmetric upside must have little competition.

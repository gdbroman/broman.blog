Different is not the same as better, it's better than better.

Consider the mediocrity of the average human life. Simply going about things differently is not a terrible strategy.

When something is different, current measuring sticks won't do. But if playing the long game, you may get to witness the measuring sticks get updated. And now different _is_ better.

Or maybe you won't - but hey, at least you weren't boring. Boring's badder than bad.

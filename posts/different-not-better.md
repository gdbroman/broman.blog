Different is not the same as better, it's better than better.

Consider mediocrity. Simply going about things differently isn't such a terrible strategy.

When something's different, contemporary yardsticks won't do. Playing the long game however, you may get to witness the yardsticks adapt. And now different _is_ better.

Or maybe you won't. Hey. At least you weren't boring. Boring's badder than bad.

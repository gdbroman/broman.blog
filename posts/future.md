You have access to the internet. Also, probably the majority of books written in the last couple of centuries; computational power Neil Armstrong couldn't have dreamt of; and – presumably – some spare time. If you are not going to predict the future, who will?

## The Filter Bubble No One Talks About

> *Medieval men despaired of the will. They thought of humans as wounded and weak. But they respected the intellect.*
>
> *Modern men worship the will, but they despair of the intellect. The wisdom of crowds; the swerve of random particles; the influence of unconscious biases: all of these contemporary clichés are ways to talk about intellectual weakness-or ways to talk ourselves into it.*

You listen to Nobel Prize winners on TV and follow business magnates on Twitter. Wherever you look, someone else (smarter, more competent) is already thinking and working on a solution to your problems. There, now; return to watching WeCrashed on Netflix.

Furthermore, what stories are being told on the big screen? Either it's a terminator that will kill you or The Matrix that will enslave you. Nothing to be done – perhaps start an underground fight club.

## The Trap of Status

To think about the future does not mean adding another line item to your resume. It does not mean getting a degree or certificate. It does not mean landing a high-status job.

These are good tracks that will generate more options down the line. But they are not thinking about the future. They might even be antithetical because thinking about the future cannot be tracked.

## You Must Be Bold

Arthur C Clark wrote there are two "hazards of prophecy: failure of nerve, [and] failure of imagination." Culture is an enemy of both.

A good way to break out of our ever-so-homogenous, Netflix-watching, Uber-eating culture is to study great works of literature. To not take a great book for granted. When you find one, study it. Reread it 15 times. Make it part of your being.

All that is certain about the future is that it will be different. No one knows how, but you need to think you do.

It has been stressful
And maybe not so fruitful
Right in this moment
But I am so grateful

I have made sacrifices
Some respectable
Others not so much
Need to ask

When we sacrifice
We have to ask
To what cause
And to what good?

Now I found this moment
And so I have to ask
To what cause
And what good?

I am drilling my psyche
Killing my self
To what cause
And what good?

But I am so grateful
Whichever the way
For I found this moment
So I got to ask

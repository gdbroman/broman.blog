It has been stressful<br />
Maybe not so fruitful<br />
Right in this moment<br />
I am so grateful

I have made sacrifices<br />
Some respectable<br />
Others not so much<br />
Need to ask

When we sacrifice<br />
We have to ask<br />
To what cause<br />
And to what good?

Now I found this moment<br />
And so I have to ask<br />
To what cause<br />
And what good?

I am drilling my psyche<br />
Killing my self<br />
To what cause<br />
And what good?

But I am so grateful<br />
Whichever the way<br />
For I found this moment<br />
A time to ask

You're fucked and I don't mean it in a derogatory way.

You know how your brain automatically ignores your nose if you don't consciously focus on it, but you can see everyone else's perfectly clear?

It is so obvious how your neighbor has character flaws. It is so obvious how your mom self-sabotages. And you could destroy your friend in a sentence.

Everyone has demons, _but why is it so goddamn hard to see your own?_ We like to think we see them. How could you know you're not blind to blindness like every other fool?

Get some brutal friends.

Once upon a time, on a tiny speck. Monkeys became aware, and now they’re depressed.

So off they went, on a meaning quest. Tried with values, grandiose and noble!

And how they searched! But to no avail. They had seen the absurd, and there was no going back.

Hopelessness! Despair! What were their options? To continue as usual? As if nothing had happened?

Never with will—not even death. Unavoidable, unseeable, absurdity prevailed.

Why hold reason to such high regard? When it cannot provide, even meaning for the scarred?

Time is brief, we are not. May I never mistake a hammer for God.

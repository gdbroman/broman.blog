Hundreds of millions of books. Computational power Neil Armstrong couldn't have dreamt of. If we can't think about the future, no one can. So why is effectively no one trying?

## The Filter Bubble No One Talks About

> Medieval men despaired of the will. They thought of humans as wounded and weak. But they respected the intellect.
>
> Modern men worship the will, but they despair of the intellect. The wisdom of crowds; the swerve of random particles; the influence of unconscious biases: all of these contemporary clichés are ways to talk about intellectual weakness-or ways to talk ourselves into it.

Either it's a terminator that will kill you or The Matrix that will enslave you. Nothing to be done – perhaps start an underground fight club. Culture in its current form is not optimistic and will not support your inventiveness.

But one way to break out of our increasingly homogenous, Netflix-watching, Uber-eating culture, is to not take great ideas for granted. Choose a tested book and reread it 15 times. And by God, do not log it on Goodreads.

## The Status Trap

To think about the future does not mean adding another line item to your resume. It does not mean getting another degree or certificate. It does not mean landing a high-status job. Pursuing these things will put you on a track, but it is not thinking about the future, because thinking about the future cannot be tracked.

All that is certain about the future is that it must be different. No one knows how, but you must be bold enought to think you do.

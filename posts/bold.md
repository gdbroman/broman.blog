Hundrerds of millions of books. Computational power Neil Armstrong couldn't have dreamt of. If we can't think about the future, no one can. So why is effectively no one trying?

## The Filter Bubble No One Talks About

> Medieval men despaired of the will. They thought of humans as wounded and weak. But they respected the intellect.

> Modern men worship the will, but they despair of the intellect. The wisdom of crowds; the swerve of random particles; the influence of unconscious biases: all of these contemporary clichés are ways to talk about intellectual weakness-or ways to talk ourselves into it.

You listen to Nobel Prize winners on TV and follow business magnates on Twitter. Wherever you look, someone else (smarter, more competent) is already thinking and working on a solution to your problems. There, now; you can return to watching WeCrashed on Netflix.

## Culture Is Not Your Friend

And what stories are we being told on the big screen? Either it's a terminator that will kill you or The Matrix that will enslave you. Nothing to be done – perhaps start an underground fight club.

Arthur C. Clark wrote there are two "hazards of prophecy: failure of nerve, [and] failure of imagination." Culture is an enemy of both. Or as Terence Mckenna said, "culture is not your friend."

One way to break out of our increasingly homogenous, Netflix-watching, Uber-eating culture is to study great works of literature. To not take a great book for granted. Reread it 15 times. Make beauty a part of your being.

## The Status Trap

To think about the future does not mean adding another line item to your resume. It does not mean getting a degree or certificate. It does not mean landing a high-status job.

Pursuing these tracks will generate more options down the line, but it is not thinking about the future – it's antithetical. Thinking about the future cannot be tracked.

All that is certain about the future is that it will be different. No one knows how, but you must be bold enought to think you do.

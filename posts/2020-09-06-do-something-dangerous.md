Not to take unnecessary risk, but risk nonetheless. To live, not merely survive.

The quickest way out of despair is doing something dangerous. Or scary. As long as the brain *interprets* danger, it seems to do the trick - does it not?

Such as moving to another country, or quitting a safe 9 to 5. For something bigger. Yearning, adventuring; living, transcending. Safety implying unrealization.

And pondering scary undertakings, one always concludes the worst-case _better_, than the amygdala's stories. We suffer only in imagination-kind-of-a-thing.

A calm mind has little to fear.

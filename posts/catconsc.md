Reality appears to be accelerating towards complexity. We do not know what this complexity is. More importantly, our role as human beings in this unfoldment—if we’ll even get to pass through the keyhole—we also do not know.

To complicate the matter, reality seems to dislike being talked about. But there’s a sense in which, through attempting to speak the unspeakable, the understanding of this isness can be accelerated on a larger scale.

## 1 Why Accelerate

_Any world order based on knowledge other than our shared being is at best a fragile alliance. To not become mechanical technocrats, the spirit somehow has to be brought along with us: To not leave our human soul behind, there have to be effective efforts in accelerating awakening. With growing existential risks, large-scale top-down governing is Russian roulette. Consistently wise species-level decision-making has to be done in a many-to-many fashion. The path isn’t quick, but it is necessary, and it starts in Mind._

### 1.1 Fundamental Okayness

In failing to look past evolutionary fear, not much has changed since first leaving the savannah. Physical needs remains the go-to space for seeking wholeness. And it is no doubt that contemporary western ontology, with its dead mechanistic outlook, has contributed to our materialistic worldview in this everyday (and not only metaphysical) sense. But what those letting go of scarcity discover—if only for a moment—is when the fight with fear subsides, a fundamental okayness remains: An inherent joy of being—which doesn't make you complacent, but which makes you okay. More likely to achieve good (such as when seeking to help corners of the world that are actually living in scarcity). So it is from this recognition the future has to be built.

### 1.2 Can We Engineer Enlightenment?

Of course, no effort in engineering enlightenment will ever be complete—will never be _it._ Like the dog fixating on your fingertip, instead of tracing the imaginary line extending beyond it—_this_ can never be explained, never fairly represented; only experienced. But as Picasso said, although art lies, it points to truth. So external efforts may be insufficient, but they are necessary. In other words, there is stuff to do.

### 1.3 What Is Happening

> Our civilization is unwell. We eat food that kills us, we’ve lost sight of beauty, and we neglect our spiritual lives. The world is deranged and decayed, and this frightens people. We don’t look up from our screens; we seek to live within them.

For most current cultural shifts, malignancy is far too early to tell. But even in gloomier cases, such as physicalist atheism, the game is far from over. Some mere intuitions:

#### 1.3.1 The Secularization of Meditation

The clinical rebranding of meditation has been two steps forward and one step back. Its nuts and bolts have been abstracted, and its deeper purpose—of awakening the practitioner—left behind. Meditation apps have played an important role in this spread via secularization. Let's just make sure the discussion doesn’t end with listicles on how a daily practice will make you a more effective worker bee.

#### 1.3.2 The Church of Technology

Second, technology has its eyes on the throne of God. When nature is merciless, we consult rationalism: when death discomforts, we turn to transhumanism. I don't think there's reason to reject this sort of religion on principle—as long as we recognize it as such. If not, we’ll end up longing for all sacred we’ve dismantled. And without disregarding theological innovation—because any misstep is associated with risks of special significance—change should be done with the utmost caution. This requires a level of wisdom that is unfortunately uncommon within the boyish field of technology.

#### 1.3.3 A Psychedelic Renaissance

Mostly through personal accounts online, and a few outspoken celebrities (Joe Rogan, Mike Tyson, Tim Ferriss), psychedelics are making a comeback—and this time with a wider appeal. More states and countries are legalizing; although similar to meditation, it is with industrial practicality as carrot whilst their real power remains largely undiscussed.

#### 1.3.4 Science Turning Its Gaze Inward

Lastly, science is going through an epistemological crisis. We are beginning to realize that science has been operating rather dogmatically with regards to its metaphysical assumptions. This is understandable. Most fields—given the same societal success—would have turned equally arrogant.

Outside thinkers and retired academics (for which the shackles of academia aren’t as heavy) are speaking up on social platforms about the pseudophilosophy that has been scientism. This is in turn encouraging some brave scientists within the system to address the naked emperor that is “matter.” The belief that all there is is matter, is rising to the surface, revealing itself as such. A belief that has produced the so-called “hard problem,” as well as a meaning crisis among its predominantly western adherers.

The science community is beginning to see how admitting these philosophical errors is but a momentary strike to the ego. It won’t eradicate all previous findings, but instead strengthen its long-term integrity: how it permits a more solid—indubitably more hopeful—interpretation of what we are doing and why.

## 2 How to Accelerate

> <cite>—Terence McKenna</cite>

Health, vitality, and the furtherance of life: this is what we're after. There are technologies (in the broader sense of the word) that can promote this—thus catalyzing consciousness, e.g:

- Blockchain & cryptocurrencies can aid the decentralization of power and thinking.
  - DAO-cities & communities focusing on natural living (sunlight, fasting, movement, cold exposure, and the like).
  - Media platforms built on public blockchains, supporting freedom of speech.
- VR games & media for induced awakening experiences. Consciousness tech is basically as old as we are (rituals, mind-altering substances, etc.) but there is likely plenty of unexplored territory using modern hardware and software.
- Psychedelics R&D, including funding and legislation.
- Meetups & gatherings of enlightened individuals (good things happen when conscious people get together—if not only to help others on the path).
  - Courses & workshops on meditation, yoga, and similar practices. Volunteer or donate to centers. Make initiatives at your workplace, university, community, etc.
- High-quality art & integrous intellectual work: Ideas change the world, and beauty will save it!

These are tools. It is likely that many more will be required for collective awakening. And, any tool being inherently neutral, we must come from a place of joy. Thankfully, it is already waiting.

On a personal note, I'm looking for future-oriented conversationalists. Topics of interest include the death of the nation state, decentralized work; monistic/analytical idealism and similar metaphysics; emerging ethics, and spirituality.

A karate kid walked up to the black belt and asked excitedly, _"how do I get as good as thou?"_

_"Ah, there's not much to it"_ said the black belt. _"It's just practice. But do not bother, you will give up soon."_

_"You watch! I'll invent new kicks, do moves never imagined. I'll become the greatest master who's ever lived! I'll show you."_ said the beginner.

Ten years later the beginner received his black belt. A white-belt walked up to him:

_"Oh master, how do I get as good as thou?"_

_"Practice 12 hours a day for ten years straight, and you may receive a black belt like me."_

The white-belt did as told. After ten years he too recieved a black belt. With a scissor he instantly cut it in half and went on to become a musician.

He was now the greatest karate master who had ever lived.

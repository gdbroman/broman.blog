title: "Shyness Is Egoism"

I can't take people who take themselves seriously seriously. Including myself. Being serious is my default setting and I hate it.

Comedians are geniuses. Society got it all wrong. It's the egomaniacs that are selfless. Those we call humble are simply hiding behind norms, but they're gods in their own minds. Shyness is nothing short of egoism. Passive self-obsession in fear of punctuating one's own fantasy.

It is the egomaniacs that gave up worrying about other's perceptions. Learned to turn their focus outwards when the situation calls for it. To risk one's self-image in order to potentially contribute. This is the way of egolessness if there ever was one.

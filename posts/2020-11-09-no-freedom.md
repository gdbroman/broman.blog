Choice is perhaps the worst thing we can possess. There's no aim in an infinitely dimensional problem space.

You want rules and constraints. Stories: *This is who I am, and this is what I do.* So you don't have to solve a mystery every morning.

Ultimate freedom paralyzes, and eats you up alive. Limitations enforce concentrated action.

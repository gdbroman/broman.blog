So they continued walking, heads slightly down. Looking at the walked-up path before them.

"Have you heard this song called the Cauliflower?"

"The cauliflower. No, Whats it about?"

Well, its instrumental—doesn't have any lyrics—but my gut says it's about the dynamic between pleasure and discipline."

"Hmm, what makes you say that?" Sierra asked.

"Well, there are two main forces, a piano and a guitar. My interpretation is that the guitar is pleasure and the piano discipline. You should listen to it, its great."

"Huh." Continuing to walk in silence.

As they passed a corner, the whole horizon was now filled by the mountain range.

"If we continue in this direction, there really is no going back."

"But why would you? It's beautiful. It is beautiful don't you think?" And so they continued, now going slightly downwards, as the path required them to go down into the valley before continuing on the magnificent mountain range's back.

"You think there are any bears down there boss?"

"Bears?! Sure don't hope so." Silence.

His pulse raised. Of course there _could_ be bears.

"nana nananannana"

"What song is that—the cauliflower?"

"Yes, I think a swede made it, I'm surprised you haven't heard of it actually."

"Actually I might have—continue humming!"

And right in that instant, a loud scream. It was Sierra. He had never heard Sierra scream. But he could never have guessed that's what it would sound like. It was clear this was not a regular-occasion type of scream. This was instinctive—a survival scream.

They stood like statues. Both knew—even though Gabriel didn't, he subconsciously understood what was the reason for this survival scream. And then he saw too. Five meters ahead the beast made itself clear. This was its part of the trail, and it was now thinking about what to do with these intruders. The intruders were thinking about what to do about the beast. Down to the right was a couple of hundred meters down to sure death. Up to the left was too steep and slow to be an option. It was either back or forward. They stood still.

It didn't seem like Sierra looked the beast in the eyes, just staring down in the ground right in front of him. But Gabriel did and now he realized that it was a bear. A _white_ bear! Not a polar bear, it must be a grizzly. The color had distracted him but now it was clear. Not a goat, not a mountain lion, a 500kg bear.

The bear raised its eyebrow and looked at him. Looked at him?

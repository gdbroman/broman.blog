With state-infested megacorps writing the narrative on what it means to live a human life—what even qualifies as such—it is easy to grow cynical about the current system, and our civilizational prospects within it.

Censorship, greed, power mania. The great resignation. The great reset. Even war could arguably be blamed on capitalism. War is incredibly good business.

But some will argue that a better world is possible. How can we reverse this agario-esque trend of a handful of entities defining our lives? 

"Conscious Capitalism" will sound like an oxymoron to some, but it is the title of Whole Foods CEO John Mackey's book that talks of what makes a business conscious. This is a book offering the white pill on capitalism. The \*consc\* pill.

How to ascend? Mackey proposes a few guiding principles, such as 1) serving all stakeholders equally (customers, employees, not just management or shareholders), and 2) having a clear purpose that is heroic and not mere profit maximization.

This is all very good and needed—critical, even. Mackey seems like a genuinely good guy. Undoubtedly, he walks his talk of ascending an org. Question is, is it enough?

It seems to me we need new tools. Yes, accompanying philosophy on how to use them too, but tools nonetheless. With tyrannical tech such as surveillance AI and social credit systems already being implemented (unhindered in China, and POC in West), the gravity of the situation calls for exit alternatives. Tools, will constitute our escape pod. One such tool is called Urbit.

## What is Urbit?

Invented by the american blogger Curtis Yarvin back in 2013, Urbit in its current state is an esoteric piece of software, known by a small group of mostly libertarian programmers. On its [landing page](https://urbit.org/), it's self-described as “A clean-slate OS and network for the 21st century." Curtis stays clear from Urbit in interviews, which doesn’t help comprehension. But apparently, the creative genius sees his job as done and wants to move on.

Here are some ways other's have described Urbit:

- A new way to relate (to others, and ideas)
- A critical upgrade to human interaction
- A new type of social computing
- A world-changing project
- A new internet

### What it is Technically

Urbit can be hard to describe because it is many things simultaneously. But in short, it as least these three:

1. A super-private computer,
2. An ID,
3. A peer-to-peer network.

Or, in one sentence:

> Urbit is a peer-to-peer internet being built from scratch to be more private, secure, and durable than the current internet.
>
> <cite><a href="https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-for-normies">—Erik Newton ~patnes-rigtyn</a></cite>

Let's look at the three components.

#### 1. A super-private computer

Your Urbit computer is best run locally on your personal computer as your own server.

Self-hosting your own data is not only great for privacy, it also solves what Balaji Srinivasan called the [data export/import problem](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/):

> On the current internet, a new app that launches tomorrow can't know who your friends are today. That's why we all have a dozen different social apps, and yet our relationships are fragmented across them (I have Twitter friends I only know on Twitter, I have family members that only have Facebook, and so on).
>
> What if all of your relationships could simply appear, automatically, in every new social app that emerges for the next 100 years?
>
> <cite>—Justin Murphy ~hatryx-lastud</cite>

People hate the boomer web like Facebook, but they stay on it because all of their friends are on it. Urbit solves this. With a self-hosted, persistent social graph.

#### 2. An ID

All of our communication channels on the internet today rely on someone else to authenticate our identity. Urbit is — to my knowledge — the first practical application of a decentralized ID system that actually works.

Your ID is pseudonomyous, meaning you can stay completely anonymous if you choose to not publically share it. This has some interesting implications.

Because all Urbit groups are unindexed, they spread via word of mouth. You find the communities you're drawn to, and are completely oblivious to cringe ones. No more heated Facebook comment sections.

People forming their own communities might seem like we’re just worsening our echo chamber. But one perspective is that when we take away the satanic algorithm, we are reviving people’s ability to focus and be proactive, so open-mindedness will increase, not decrease.

#### 3. A peer-to-peer network

Today if you want to talk with other people on the network, you have to go through an intermediary. Servers, owned by Google, Facebook, etc. The short term cost is your data which is stored on those servers. The long term cost is the your time and attention which those corporations sell to advertisers.

Because Urbit has a decentralized ID system, it cuts out the middlemen and lets you talk directly with people on the network. This has huge benefit for privacy and integrety. More below.

## How will Urbit it save us?

> *Our civilization is unwell. We eat food that kills us, we’ve lost sight of beauty, and we neglect our spiritual lives. The world is deranged and decayed, and this frightens people. We don’t look up from our screens; we seek to live within them.
>

Take a close listen to these boomer web keywords: "feed", "influencer", "push notification". What do they all have in common? They're all very intrusive. The boomer web is a very rough place, where you as a browser assume this defensive position of trying to save your last bit of time and attention. Worst part is, there is no “them.” Even the developers and advertisers are themselves addicted to their phones.

The last couple of decades, it has been redefined what it means to be a human. Smaller attention span, less freedom, no proactivity. No dignity. Yeah you *could* exit socials, but *can* you. We’re social creatures, we need an alternative. Do you wish these big corps to continue having this power over you?

Make no mistake, there’s an information war going on, and Urbit is here to help you not fight, but exit. On Urbit you're asked to be proactive in what to consume. Instead of shielding your attention span from penetration, you will have to actively seek out information. There’s no feed, you eat when you want.

Furthermore, Urbit's design implements a philosophy called calm computing. No notifications or blinking lights. The computer is a tool, to empower humans, respecting their time and attention. What if we increased our attention spans?

If the goal is prosperity with individual sovereignty, we’ll need new social computation. There are alternatives like Ceramic and DeSo but they are not as popular. This might change of course, but Urbit currently has the biggest small group of loyal adherents.

### How to get started

All you really need is a planet. To get one, you’ve got two alternatives: buy one as an NFT on OpenSea or urbit.live. The problem is that Ethereum fees are sky high so I wouldn’t recommend it. The other alternative is to ask someone with a star to give one away to you for free or a discounted price, since stars can keep generating planets. For this I can really recommend Justin Murphy’s website [imperceptible.computer](http://imperceptible.computer) where he does exactly this.

Secondly you’ll need to boot your planet. This is the easy part. Urbit has made this really simple now, so all you need to do is to download their Mac or Windows app called Port, where you can boot up your planet locally on your computer in less than 5 minutes.

## Mass exodus wen?

Urbit is still technically difficult to get on for the average person. So not until my mom can get on it can we even start to entertain the thought of a mass exodus.

But even when the UX is ready, there are still network effects.

So probably a dramatic event like a breach that crashed the whole boomer web will have to happen for everyone to move over to Urbit. For now, though, it’s mostly libertarian nerds. But this just makes for a more fun experience imo!

### The End of History

According to Heidegger, since the start of philosophy, we have been concerned with simple matters. Each epoch allowing for a capped radicality in worldview. He suggested that only now, are we entering the epoch of a *whole* world view, tied with the threat of complete instrumentalization of our world via tech. Becoming more things than persons. 

Awake from oblivion we will. The question is how. I'm choosing Urbit.

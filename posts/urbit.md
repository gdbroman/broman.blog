With state-infested megacorps writing the narrative on what it means to live a human life—what even qualifies as such—it is easy to grow cynical about the current system, and our civilizational prospects within it.

Censorship, greed, power mania. The great resignation. The great reset. Even war could arguably be blamed on capitalism. War is incredibly good business.

But some will argue that a better world is possible. How can we reverse this agario-esque trend of a handful of entities defining our lives? 

"Conscious Capitalism" will sound like an oxymoron to some, but it is the title of Whole Foods CEO John Mackey's book that talks of what makes a business conscious. This is a book offering the white pill on capitalism. The \*consc\* pill.

How to ascend? Mackey proposes a few guiding principles, such as 1) serving all stakeholders equally (customers, employees, not just management or shareholders), and 2) having a clear purpose that is heroic and not mere profit maximization.

This is all very good and needed—critical, even. Mackey seems like a genuinely good guy. Undoubtedly, he walks his talk of ascending an org. Question is, is it enough?

It seems to me we need new tools. Yes, accompanying philosophy on how to use them too, but tools nonetheless. With tyrannical tech such as surveillance AI and social credit systems already being implemented, the gravity of the situation calls for exit alternatives. Tools, will constitute our escape pod. One such tool is called Urbit.

## What is Urbit?

Urbit in its current state is an esoteric piece of software, known by a small group of mostly libertarian programmers, used by fewer still. On their [landing page](https://urbit.org/), they describes it as “A clean-slate OS and network for the 21st century."

It was invented by the programmer and blogger Curtis Yarvin back in 2013. Curtis stays clear from Urbit in interviews, which doesn’t make things easier. Apparently, the creative genius sees his job as done and wants to move on.

Here are some ways to describe Urbit

- A new type of social computing
    - Offering new ways to relate. To others, to ideas.
- A critical upgrade to human interaction
- A world-changing project
- A new internet

### Okay, so like what is it again? (technically)

> Urbit is a challenging project to fully describe because, rather than a single product, it’s an entire system. Often when I talk about one of the individual elements of the system, someone will tell me that another company is already building that — and they’re usually right. What sets Urbit apart is that we’re building all these elements at once to work together seamlessly.

Urbit is a peer-to-peer internet being built from scratch to be more private, secure, and durable than the current internet.

At its most basic level, an Urbit is:

1. A super-private computer, combined with
2. an ID, which is
3. connected peer-to-peer with other Urbit computers.

Also, calm computing. No notifications or blinking lights. The computer is a tool, to empower humans, respecting their time and attention.

All of our communication channels on the internet today rely on someone else to authenticate our identity. Urbit is — to my knowledge — the first practical application of a decentralized ID system that actually works.

### Attention, and a Persistent Social Graph

“On the current internet, a new app that launches tomorrow can't know who your friends are today. That's why we all have a dozen different social apps, and yet our relationships are fragmented across them (I have Twitter friends I only know on Twitter, I have family members that only have Facebook, and so on).”

People hate the boomer web like Facebook, but they stay on it because all of their friends are on it. Network effects.

But the business model is fucked up. Facebook themselves admitted to doing research on how to make people feel bad. [source] Just to have them stay on longer so they can sell more of our time and data to advertisers.

What if all of your relationships could simply appear, automatically, in every new social app that emerges for the next 100 years?

What if we increased our attention spans?

## Unindexed web 3.6

The boomer web is conducting an information war. Urbit on the other hand, asks you to be proactive in what to consume. Instead of shielding your attention span from people trynna penetrate, you will have to actively seek out information.

Groups are unindexed and spread mostly via word of mouth (or the boomer web still ofc).

And there’s basically no feed.

It’s not forcing you anything.

You’ll eat only what you want.

## Why do we need Urbit / How will it save us?

> *Our civilization is unwell. We eat food that kills us, we’ve lost sight of beauty, and we neglect our spiritual lives. The world is deranged and decayed, and this frightens people. We don’t look up from our screens; we seek to live within them.

The last couple of decades, it has been redefined what it means to be a human. Smaller attention span, less freedom, no proactivity. No dignity. Yeah you *could* exit socials, but *can* you. We’re social creatures, we need an alternative. I do not want these big corps to continue having this power over me.

There’s an information war going on. Worst part is, there is no “them.” Even the powers at be are themselves addicted to their phones. Tyrannical tech has become a force of its own.

The goal is prosperity with individual sovereignty. For this, we’ll need new social computation.

There are alternatives like Ceramic and DeSo but they are not as popular. That might change of course, but Urbit currently has the biggest small group of loyal adherents.

## Is siloing groups really good?

People forming their own communities might seem like we’re just worsening our echo chamber.

One perspective: when we take away the satanic algorithm, thus bringing back people’s attention span and proactivity with regards to learning, open-mindedness will increase, not decrease.

### How to get started

All you really need is a planet. To get one, you’ve got two alternatives: buy one as an NFT on OpenSea or urbit.live. The problem is that Ethereum fees are sky high so I wouldn’t recommend it. The other alternative is to ask someone with a star to give one away to you for free or a discounted price, since stars can keep generating planets. For this I can really recommend Justin Murphy’s website [imperceptible.computer](http://imperceptible.computer) where he does exactly this.

Secondly you’ll need to boot your planet. This is the easy part. Urbit has made this really simple now, so all you need to do is to download their Mac or Windows app called Port, where you can boot up your planet locally on your computer in less than 5 minutes.

## Will everyone really move over to Urbit?

Urbit is still technically difficult to get on for the average person. So not until my mom can get on it can we even start to entertain the thought of a mass exodus.

But even when the UX is ready, there are still network effects.

So probably a dramatic event like a breach that crashed the whole boomer web will have to happen for everyone to move over to Urbit. For now, though, it’s mostly libertarian nerds. But this just makes for a more fun experience imo!

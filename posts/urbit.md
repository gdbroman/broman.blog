With state-infested megacorps writing the narrative on what it means to live a human life—what even qualifies as such—it is easy to grow cynical about the current system, and our civilizational prospects within it.

Censorship, greed, power mania. The great resignation. The great reset. Even war could arguably be blamed on capitalism. War is incredibly good business.

But some will argue that a better world is possible. How can we reverse this agario-esque trend of a handful of entities defining our lives? 

"Conscious Capitalism" will sound like an oxymoron to some, but it is the title of Whole Foods CEO John Mackey's book that talks of what makes a business conscious. This is a book offering the white pill on capitalism. The \*consc\* pill.

How to ascend? Mackey proposes a few guiding principles, such as 1) serving all stakeholders equally (customers, employees, not just management or shareholders), and 2) having a clear purpose that is heroic and not mere profit maximization.

This is all very good and needed—critical, even. Mackey seems like a genuinely good guy. Undoubtedly, he walks his talk of ascending an org. Question is, is it enough?

It seems to me we need new tools. Yes, accompanying philosophy on how to use them too, but tools nonetheless. With tyrannical tech such as surveillance AI and social credit systems already being implemented (unhindered in China, and POC here in West), the gravity of the situation calls for exit alternatives. Tools will constitute our escape pod, and one such tool is Urbit.

## What is Urbit?

Invented by the american blogger Curtis Yarvin back in 2013, Urbit in its current state is an esoteric piece of software, known by a small group of libertarian programmers; used by even fewer still. On its [landing page](https://urbit.org/), it describes itself as “A clean-slate OS and network for the 21st century." Ok. Curtis stays clear from Urbit in interviews, which doesn’t help, but apparently the creative genius sees his job as [done](https://urbit.org/blog/a-founders-farewell) and wants to move on.

Here's how others have described it:

- A new way to relate (to others, and ideas)
- A critical upgrade to human interaction
- A new type of social computing
- A world-changing project
- A new internet

### What it is technically

Urbit can be hard to describe because it is many things simultaneously. But in short, it's at least three things:

1. A super-private computer,
2. An identity,
3. A peer-to-peer network.

Or, in one sentence:

> Urbit is a peer-to-peer internet being built from scratch to be more private, secure, and durable than the current internet.
>
> <cite><a href="https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-for-normies">—Erik Newton ~patnes-rigtyn</a></cite>

Let's have a look at these three components separately.

#### Component 1. A super-private computer

Your Urbit computer is best run locally, with your personal computer functioning as your own server. Self-hosting your data is not only great for privacy, it also solves what Balaji Srinivasan called the [data export/import problem](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/):

> What if all of your relationships could simply appear, automatically, in every new social app that emerges for the next 100 years?
>
> <cite>—Justin Murphy ~hatryx-lastud</cite>

People hate Facebook, but they stay on it because their friends are on it. Not until we take matters into our own hands by self-hosting can we genuinely expect features like a persistent social graph. Their land, their rules.

#### Component 2. An identity

All of our communication channels on the internet today rely on someone else to authenticate our identity. Urbit utilizes a decentralized identity system, where your ID is pseudonymous, meaning you can stay completely anonymous if you choose to not publically share it. This has some interesting implications.

Because all Urbit groups are unindexed, they spread via word of mouth. So you find the communities you're drawn to, but stay oblivious to ones that make you cringe or enraged. No more heated comment sections.

People siloing into self-selected communities might seem like we’re just worsening the echo chamber. But one perspective is that when we take away the algorithm, we are reviving people’s ability to focus and think for themselves. So open-mindedness should increase as a result, not decrease.

#### Component 3. A peer-to-peer network

Today if you want to talk to other people on the internet, you have to go through an intermediary: Servers, owned by Google, Facebook, etc. The short-term cost is your data, which is stored on those servers. The long-term cost is your time and attention which those corporations use to sell to advertisers.

Because Urbit has a decentralized ID system, it cuts out the middlemen and lets you talk directly with people on the network. This has huge benefits for privacy and integrity.

Furthermore, Urbit implements a design philosophy called calm computing. With no notifications or blinking lights, it's going back to the original conception of the computer as a tool, to empower the human, treating its time and attention as something to be respected—not extracted. It strives to answer the question: *What if we increased our attention spans?*

## How will Urbit save us?

Take a closer look at keywords like, "feed", "influencer", and "push notification". What do they all have in common? They describe a [master/slave relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)) between information producers and you as a consumer.

Like a hot girl entering a biker bar, just by logging on, one defaults to a compromised position, having to defend oneself from intruders. "Surfing" is now but a relic of our naive retro-future—the current web more aptly described as being "survived" or "trekked".

Make no mistake about it, there is an information war taking place, and it is happening on the boomer web. The price? Your attention. Worst part is, there is no “them.” Even curators and producers (devs, influencers, advertisers) are themselves addicted to their phones, and self-censoring their speech.

In the last couple of decades, it has been radically redefined what it means to be a human. Shorter attention span, less freedom of mind, less proactivity. No dignity. Urbit solves this. Not by partaking in the information war, but by offering an alternative. Because yeah you *could* quit socials, but will you? We’re social creatures in need of an alternative—without a "feed," to eat when we want.

## How to get started

All you really need to get started is a planet. A planet is the permanent identity you'll use to navigate the Urbit network. It's a bit like a crypto wallet. But you can think of it more like a digital piece of land, that you buy once, and own forever.

To get hold of a planet, you’ve got two alternatives. The first is to buy one as an NFT on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id) or [urbit.live](https://urbit.live/). The problem is that Ethereum fees are sky-high, so I wouldn’t recommend it. The other alternative is to ask someone with a star to give one away to you for free or at a discounted price, since each star is capable of issuing 65,535 unique planets. For this, I can really recommend Justin Murphy’s website [imperceptible.computer](http://imperceptible.computer) where he does exactly this.

Second, you’ll need to boot up your planet, but this is the easy part. Urbit has made it real simple now, so all you need to do is download their app called [Port](https://urbit.org/getting-started#port) which is available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows, where you can boot up your planet locally on your computer in less than 5 minutes.

Worth mentioning is that there are alternatives like [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and [DeSo](https://www.deso.org/). But Urbit has the biggest small group of loyal adherents, at least for now.

## Mass exodus wen?

Urbit is still technically difficult to get on for the average person. So not until my mom can boot up her own planet can we even start to entertain the thought of a mass exodus. Even when the UX is ready, there are still network effects.

So probably a dramatic event, like a massive password breach, making the old web unusable, will have to happen for the majority to consider moving over. For now, though, it’s mostly fringe nerds. It just makes it a more fun experience IMO.

An ending note: According to Heidegger, we have since the start of philosophy been concerned with simple matters. Each epoch allowing for a capped radicality in worldview. And he suggested that only now are we entering the epoch of a *whole* world view, along with the rising threat of a complete instrumentalization of our world via tech; risking becoming more things than persons. Maybe it's time to choose a ship wisely.

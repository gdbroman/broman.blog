_You think it's about the reward, motherfucker?_

_Are you kidding me? I'm not._

_You, me - we're all gonna die. Before you know it, you're six feet under without having realized who you are. A whole life mistaking water for the the bowl._

_Haven't you understood anything?_

_You think I identify with the outcome? You can keep that conditional-happiness, attachment-shit in your pocket._

Then I get angry for getting angry over such petty things outside of my control:

_Haven't I understood anything?_

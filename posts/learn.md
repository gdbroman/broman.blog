title: Are You Learning New Tech with TOO MUCH EFFORT?

Learning new tech can be like going to WAR.

It takes...

* **courage** (to enter the unknown)
* **pain tolerance** (to sit with discomfort)

A serious level of WILL is required.

**But learning new tech doesn't have to be taxing.**

This sense-based method has helped me self-teach with less effort:

## Step 1. Run a code snippet

Find the smallest possible  code snippet for the theory you're learning, and get it to run it locally.

Poke at it.

See what happens.

Poking around will skyrocket your understanding because you're mining first-hand knowledge.

## Step 2. Find a non-tech analogy

Some concepts are too big to be run as code snippets.

And putting *every single concept you learn* into practice is too time-consuming.

This is where non-tech analogies come in handy.

### *Example:* Scaling a bakery

I'm currently reading *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*. It's about distributed systems – huge topic! – very scary!! But if I build something for every new concept in this book, I'll finish when I'm 60.

So what I can do instead is think up non-tech analogies that exemplify the theory.

For instance, the different types of systems scaling can be compared to managing a bakery:

* *Vertical scaling* = paying the bread baker more money
* *Horizontal scaling* = hiring another bread baker

See how this *brings it down?*

## Senses are your best friend

Both these steps have the same premise: **jargon is the enemy**.

Jargon will trick you into thinking you understand something you don't.

I think this is because our nervous system is way older than our neocortex.

**Abstractions shut off our brains**.

Always dumb down a new concept to something you can TRY or ANALOGIZE.

Bring it down to the senses.

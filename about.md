title: What's this website about?
---

Hello.

I'm Gustaf.

Every morning I sit down and write for about an hour.

This website is the result.

## Why?
The quick answer is...

1. Writing is fun
2. It helps me think

The complicated answer is that I can't not write. That I begin to rot if I go more than one day without writing. Like as if my thoughts are tangling themselves into a big knot up there.

## Err...Who are you?
Who am I? That's a tough one.

I'm gonna have to come back for a more definite answer.

## What's your day job?
I'm an indiehacker - which means I code stuff on the interwebs that generate income.

I'm also as an engineering student in my spare time, currently based in cold Stockholm.

Here's me being a bit more professional: [Portfolio](https://gustafbroman.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

## What's been your greatest realization in life?
That no one really knows what's going on. We just vary in our ability to pretend we do. But really...no one does.

This has made me freer to try new things and more daring to ask stupid questions.

## Okay. How do I reach out?
If you have any inquiries or propositions, you may reach out via the following email adress: contact@gustafdbroman.com

## What Wordpress theme is this?
This website is not running on Wordpress. I coded my own [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} theme and deployed it for free with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Why? Because I'm a perfectionistic control freak who craves authority over every pixel and byte.

## Are you writing these questions to yourself?
Maybe. No comment.

Shoot.

## Moving on...What do you write about?
I've gradually come to realize that all of my goals can be traced back to two more grandiose ones.

A mission statement for life, if you will.

Namely, to

1. Understand life
2. Successfully operate within it by being useful

## I asked what you write about not your freaking mission statement
But they're the same! Don't you see?

These two missions are what every article on here originate from.

## What a megalomaniac!
Although this is a personal website, it's not about me. Or at least, that's not my goal.

The aim here is to discuss ideas. Ideas which can possibly be helpful to all of us (that's also a personal reminder to keep narcissism down at a healthy level).

So if some of this seems interesting to you, then I warmly welcome you to read the blog and join me on a journey of figuring out life.

Hello.

I'm Gustaf.

Every morning I sit down and write.

This website is the result.

## Why?

The quick answer is...

1. Writing is fun
2. It helps me think

The complicated answer is that I can't _not_ write.

That I begin to rot if I go more than one day without writing. Like as if my thoughts are tangling themselves into a big knot up there 🧠 It's a weird form of therapy.

Accordingly, I don't run any ads or analytics on here - nor will I ever. The goal is authentic expression.

## Err...Who are you?

Who am I? That’s a tough one.

I’m gonna have to come back for a more definite answer.

Question: *Are you confused?* This uniquely weird universe confuses me every day. Let's be confused together.

## What's your day job?

👨‍💻 I'm an indie hacker, as well as a university student, currently experimenting with the whole 🌎 digital nomad thing, due to all learning being held online.

## Okay. How do I reach out?

☕️ Wanna chat? Send me an email: hello@broman.blog.

I’m always up for meeting new people - either through video chat, or over a coffee, if we happen to be in the same city. Hit me up and we’ll work something out!

## What WordPress theme is this?

This website is not running SlowPress. I created my own Jekyll theme and deployed it for free using Github Pages.

## What has been your greatest realization in life?

That no one really knows what's going on. We just vary in our ability to pretend we do. But really...no one does.

This has made me freer to try new things and more willing to look stupid.

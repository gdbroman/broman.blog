title: What's this website about?
---

Hello.

I'm Gustaf.

Every morning I sit down and write for about an hour.

This website is the result.

## Why?

The quick answer is...

1. Writing is fun
2. It helps me think

The complicated answer is that I can't _not_ write. 

üß† That I begin to rot if I go more than one day without writing. Like as if my thoughts are tangling themselves into a big knot up there. It's a weird form of therapy.

Accordingly, I don't run any ads or analytics on here - nor will I ever. The goal is authentic expression.

## Err...Who are you?

Who am I? That‚Äôs a tough one.

I‚Äôm gonna have to come back for a more definite answer.

## What's your day job?

üíª I'm an indie hacker, which means I code stuff on the internet.

I'm also an engineering student in my spare time, currently based in cold Stockholm.

Here's me being a bit more professional: [Portfolio](https://gustafbroman.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

## Okay. How do I reach out?

Send me an email: [contact@gustafdbroman.com](mailto:contact@gustafdbroman.com).

‚òïÔ∏è Wanna chat? I'm always up for meeting new people. Include [Coffee] in the subject line and we can work something out.

## What Wordpress theme is this?

This website is not running bloated Slowpress. I created my own [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} theme and deployed it for free using Github Pages.

Like what you see? Good news: This website is open source! You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/gustafbroman/broman.blog){:target="_blank"}.

## What's been your greatest realization in life?

That no one really knows what's going on. We just vary in our ability to pretend we do. But really...no one does.

This has made me freer to try new things and more daring to ask stupid questions.

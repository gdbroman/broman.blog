title: What's this website about?
---

Hello.

I'm Gustaf.

Every morning I sit down and write for about an hour.

This website is the result.

## Why?
The quick answer is...

1. Writing is fun
2. It helps me think

The complicated answer is that I can't _not_ write. That I begin to rot if I go more than one day without writing. Like as if my thoughts are tangling themselves into a big knot up there.

**I don't run any ads or analytics on here. And I never will.** The goal is authentic expression. My thoughts: no more, no less.

## Err...Who are you?
Who am I? That's a tough one.

I'm gonna have to come back for a more definite answer.

## What's your day job?
I'm an indiehacker, which means I code stuff on the internet.

I'm also as an engineering student in my spare time, currently based in cold Stockholm.

Here's me being a bit more professional: [Portfolio](https://gustafbroman.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

## What's been your greatest realization in life?
That no one really knows what's going on. We just vary in our ability to pretend we do. But really...no one does.

This has made me freer to try new things and more daring to ask stupid questions.

## Okay. How do I reach out?
If you have any inquiries or propositions, you may reach out via the following email adress: contact@gustafdbroman.com

## What Wordpress theme is this?
This website is not running on Wordpress. I coded my own [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} theme and deployed it for free using Github Pages.

Why? Because I'm a perfectionistic control freak who craves authority over every pixel and byte.

Like what you see? Good news! This website is open source. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/gustafbroman/blog){:target="_blank"}.

## Are you writing these questions to yourself?
Maybe, no comment.

Shoot.

## Moving on...What do you write about?
I've gradually come to realize that all of my goals can be traced back to two more grandiose ones.

A mission statement for life, if you will.

Namely, to
1. Understand life
2. Be useful

## I asked what you write about not your freaking mission statement
But they're the same! Don't you see?

It's what every article on here originate from.

## What a megalomaniac!
Although this is a _personal_ website, it's not about me. Or at least, that's not my goal.

The aim here is to freely discuss ideas. Ideas which can possibly be helpful to all of us.

So if any of this seems interesting to you, feel free to read the blog, and join me on a journey of figuring out life and being useful.

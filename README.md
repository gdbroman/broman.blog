This personal website of mine has tried out many different clothes over the years. WordPress, static HTML, Jekyll, and now Next.js. To me, this is part of the fun. Each time we start anew, there's opportunity to learn something new. Feel free to copy this setup for yourself, whathever the outfit it is wearing now.

Let's get real: money is important. And times are changing. You won't be able to do as the previous generation did: to get a stable job and work there till you retire.

Things are a lot more uncertain nowadays. But there is also way more oppurtunity than there has ever been! _If_ you take the time to learn some high income skills.

The following are viable online side hustles for 2020, though most can also be turned into full-time jobs.

## 1. Blogging

Even if you don't want to monetize your blog, it's still great for branding and using it as leverage for marketing your potential product down the road.

But if making money blogging is your goal, it's a great thing - given that you enjoy writing. Because you will need to write. A LOT.

The most common ways of monetizing a blog is to use affiliate marketing or display ads.

## 2. Flipping on Ebay and Amazon (or just selling via Amazon FBA)

Along with garage sales, this has become somewhat of a Garyvee meme. But as of 2020, selling on Amazon actually still seem to be pretty profitable. Gary Vaynerchuk himself suggests buying stuff cheap on Ebay and selling them at a higher price on Amazon.

And to paraphrase Gary: if you're living in your mom's basement, don't tell me flipping "isn't scalable". First, make enough money to sustain yourself - then we can start talking about scaling.

## 3. Code and Sell Software

This one's for the tech-savvy out there. If you know how to code - preferably web development - you can make money off of web applications.

What's so great about web apps is that the financial barrier of entry is so low. All you basically need to pay for is a domain, server hosting and then you're good to go.

And what makes it even better is, because of the knowledge barrier of entry (i.e. programming skills) the competition isn't as intense as for Shopify drop shipping for instance.

Then there's many other options such as selling iOS and android apps, or downloadable desktop software. These are also viable options but they're not as easy as web applications. No one downloads a new app anymore. It's just easier to grab people's attention in the web browser than in the app store.

## 4. Building a Youtube channel

Compared to software and blogging - building a Youtube channel is somewhat of a newcomer. Now people take it for granted but "being a youtuber" was barely heard of ten years ago. It just goes to show how of a dynamic environment the internet is.

And Youtube is a promising side hustle. It's got almost the same business model as a blog with ads and affiliate marketing and if you provide unique content you can cash in some serious cash. Right now it may actually have the highest pay to effort-ratio among all the side hustles. It’s just hard to know for how long that will last.

My prediction for Youtube is that - though the market will become increasingly saturated - it won’t become as bad as drop shipping for instance. That’s because, as a youtuber, you will always have that possibility of differentiability through your unique personal brand.

That’s my two cents at least.

## 5. Social Media Marketing (SMM)

As a social media marketing agency you simply help other companies out with their online presence. One option is to freelance and only do one time gigs such as creating Facebook ads. 

Alternatively, if this is your thing, you can acquire long-term clients as a marketing consultancy agency.

## 6. Drop Shipping With Shopify

I've saved drop shipping for last since it has undeniably become less lucrative as a business model the last few years. That's partly because the barrier of entry has become ridiculously low and therefore the competition sky high thanks to Shopify. Any kid with a laptop can open up a e-commerce store now.

That's not to say that drop shipping is dead. The market has simply become saturated so don't expect it to live up to the hype that surrounded it a couple of years ago.

## Conclusion

With the possible exceptions of dropshipping and SMM (due to a saturated market), all of these side hustles are still going strong in 2020. You simply have to put in the work.

All in all and In my opinion, blogging and software in general are the most scalable and reliable side (and full-time) hustle’s because they offer the most differentiability for your product.

Are some truths not worth exploring?

Is truth the noblest goal there is? Is it more important than beauty? Than usefulness? Or are they always the same thing?

I used to think that one should seek truth at all cost. But I’ve come to realize that in order to live a maximally meaningful life, usefulness - not truth - is probably a better metric to track.

Because some truths are simply not helpful - such as; determinism, nihilism and that the world probably is unfair.

Am I saying ignorance is bliss? Not exactly. I’m not suggesting adopting false beliefs - only to be more selective of the true ones you pick.

Think of your thoughts like any other diet. Food determines your energy level and physiology. Likewise, thoughts determine your mental state.

1. Thoughts determine perception
2. Perception determines behavior
3. Behavior determines the outcome of one’s life
4. Thus, if you seek to control your life - be careful of what you think

And paradoxically - analogous to pursuing meaning over happiness - that which is useful for living a good life, has its way of presenting itself as True after a while. Even if it did not seem like it at first.

So instead of asking yourself “is this true?” Ask, “is it useful?”

If not - discard it.

It has become fashionable to preach coding nowadays. That everyone should #learntocode RIGHT NOW!

The reasoning is that, since software is so ubiquitous now, everyone should at least understand the basics of computer programming.

But as someone who started programming at 13 years old, I think this is somewhat lazy thinking.

First of all, most people don’t voluntarily pick up new skills AT ALL. The average person is so tired after the daily 9 to 5 that they immediately collapse in front of Netflix. Going on Codecademy or opening up a computer science textbook is the last thing on their mind. So to think that everyone is all of a sudden going to start to self-educate is naive.

Secondly, those who are lifelong learners have either already picked up coding a long time ago - or will inevitably end up doing so out of curiosity.

**But practicality aside; is programming still the most valuable skill you can learn right now?** Or are there some other skills, more worthy of your time?

You have to put it into context like that because there’s always an opportunity cost. Every minute you spend learning or doing X could be a minute spent on Y.

And my view is that - no, coding is NOT the most valuable skill to practice. It’s up there, but there’s at least two things you should be prioritizing more: reading and writing - primarily writing.

It’s not as sexy, I agree. However, don’t let it’s simplicity fool you.

But “most people already know how to read and write!” you might object. “You learn those things in primary school.”

No. No you don’t. That’s wrong.

Learning how to write is not a binary thing that you either know or don’t. The ability to conjure up grammatically correct sentences doesn’t cut it. Then you’ve barely scratched the surface of what it means to become a good writer.

## Writing Every Day Has Been My Best Life Decision So Far
I started writing every day about six months ago.

I’m like a machine now.

In conversations the words just flow. I think clearer. I make better decisions. My mind is more structured (with emphasis on more - it’s still a mess).

Because writing is thinking, really. Crystalized thinking.

Everyone’s a genius up in their own head. It’s not until you put down your thoughts on paper that you can start to build some self awareness of your thought process - or lack of it, rather.

## Three Sentences a Day Keeps Delusion Away
Pick up a journal, typewriter or open Google Docs - it doesn’t matter. Just sit down at the same time every day and jot down your thoughts.

How much is not the point. But at least three sentences can be a good goal. You’ll probably surpass that, but it’s small enough to not be intimidating and give you writer’s block.

If you do this, slowly but steadily you’ll clear up your thinking. Your mind will become stiller, sharper and more creative.

Good luck.

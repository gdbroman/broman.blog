These are some thoughts after having listened to artist London Tsai on Eric Weinstein's podcast The Portal, Ep. #014.

The cards that evolution have dealt us only allow our brains to perceive a fraction of all light. A fraction which we solopsistically call "visible light".

Analogously, in mathematics, because of the prefrontal cortex humans have been dealt, we can only visualize a small fraction of all mathematical ideas. So there's this whole world out there which we can't visualize - much less, see.

Now, just as science have enabled us to discover the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum, symbolism enables us to explore mathematical ideas we can't visualize. It enables us to transcend our primitive senses and biologically imposed cognitive limits.

No one today would claim that gamma rays are any less real than the visible spectrum - nor that they are a human construct. And yet, this is a fairly common notion for unintuitive concepts in mathematics, such as complex numbers or higher dimensions.

I think, however, that we're at a turning point. As Weinstein put it: mathematical texts have all been sitting in libraries like unplayed sheet music. And most people can't experience music's beauty until it's performed by a musician. It was not until engineering enabled us to detect invisible light that people's opinions about its "fakeness" was changed. Similarly, mathematical artists like Tsai and Escher may thus come to play an important role in changing skeptics mind's when it comes to math.

It may soon become common sense that the mathematical world is just as real as the physical. That it's a separate entity. And that mathematics is therefore discovered - not invented.

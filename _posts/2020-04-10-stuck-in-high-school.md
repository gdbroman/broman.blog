Whenever you feel bad about yourself, there's a high chance it's because you're valuing other people's opinions over your own happiness.

It doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to people and their feedback. But for most, that's a lesser problem than the fear of judgement.

Most people are, mentally, still stuck in high school.

Replaying mean comments.

Letting previous peers own real estate in your head.

Always there to judge.

Obviously! It's not hard to understand why. Teenage years are very formative for humans.

But at some point you have to let that shit go.

Because it won't be your life until you do.

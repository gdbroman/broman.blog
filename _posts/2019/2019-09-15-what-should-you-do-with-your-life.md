Maybe there is another life after this one. Maybe not. It’s hard to know that’s for sure. It’s the kind of thing you just have to wait and see to find out about. But that’s always something - at least you have something to look forward to.

Either way; it would be one hell of a bummer to live your whole life believing in another life after death only to find out you were wrong this whole time. So it seems to me that it’s safest to assume that this is all you will ever get. As Jordan Peterson eloquently laid out in an lecture: _"You’re all in. Whether you like it or not - this thing will kill you"_. So why not try to make something useful of this thing called life?

## Recognize It Is You Who Is Being Asked

This raises a natural follow up question: what the heck should you do? It is perhaps the most important question any sentient and sufficiently intelligent being could ask oneself. It is also important to acknowledge that “it is we ourselves who must answer the questions that life asks of us” (Victor Frankl). In other words: it is up to you to determine your life’s meaning. 

Unfortunately not very many people give the question serious thought. Most cling to whatever cliché they like the sound of the most given their life circumstances, such as “follow your passion” or “do what makes you happy”. These are not necessarily bad frameworks, but the point is that most people embrace prepackaged answers with no regard to their level of truth. 

This unwillingness to ponder might be because the question of what one should do seems too big for a mortal to ever answer. Some might reason that it’s better then to just pick an answer and get going. Times running out - better not waste any time! This might actually not be such a bad strategy.

We’ve all had a moment of realization as adolescents when it truly hit us that these authority figures called adults haven’t really got it all figured out. In fact, most people don’t have any idea of what’s really going on.

If you’re hesitant to believe me, ask the wisest people you know the following: “You’re a real smart guy. So I had this little question regarding the very nature of existence. What and why should one do with one’s life?”. You’ll be lucky if you get even one coherent and - more importantly - original answer. Because any fool can recite the answer given by an ideology or another thinker but to answer for yourself requires more discipline and open-mindedness than most are willing to spare.

## An Algorithm for Figuring Out Life

Considering the premise that no one really knows what’s going on, neither what one should do here in life, maybe it’s wisest to just pick a target and aim for it without thinking too much about what the target should be? To my estimation this is necessary but not sufficient. In order to really figure life out you need to do one more thing: evaluation.

Every time you realize that the target you’ve been aiming for wasn’t that good of a choice, you have to be able to change course - and quickly! This ability to reiterate one’s attempts by trial and error is the only tool available to he who wishes to find truth. The only way to really know something is to try it. 

But constant reiteration isn’t enough either. Since life is limited there is a possibility that you might get unlucky and never hit the right target before death. Therefore you also need to be smart about choosing new targets. You have to be able to analyze what was wrong with your previous target and based on that choose a new one. And it also makes sense to maximize the amount of targets you try since a larger sample size increases your ability to evaluate your endevours.

We can thus stipulate the following algorithm for figuring life out (math geeks will realize this is analogous to some numerical methods for approximately solving differential equations such as Euler's method):

1. Pick a target
2. Work towards it (for a while)
3. Evaluate
4. Repeat

Now, anyone can pick a target and most can also aim their efforts somewhat but the third step might be easier said than done. How do you objectively evaluate your situation? After all, the easiest person to fool is yourself. You will never reach full objectiveness since your perspective will nevertheless always be a perspective and thus a subjective evaluation. But you can improve, and in order to do that you will need a map.

What map you choose will impact your evaluation and therefore also future targets. In other words; the map will fully influence your journey to truth. The choice of map should thus be of the highest interest. 

When it comes to maps, many different alternatives have been suggested throughout history but only lately have non-religious versions become widespread. Examples of this would be philosophies such as nihilism, hedonism and stoicism.

It is up to each individual to evaluate the helpfulness of different maps but I'd lastly like to present a framework which I personally resonate with. 

It was first presented to me by Victor Frankl, although the idea far predates him. 

It goes something like this: Life is suffering so the only way forward is to transcend it. This can be done by taking on more responsibility and trying to be some kind of hero who makes the suffering in the world less. 

By assigning meaning to each and every action, life will by definition, become ultimately meaningful.

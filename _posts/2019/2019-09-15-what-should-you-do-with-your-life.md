Maybe there is another life after this one. Maybe not. It’s hard to know that’s for sure. It’s the kind of thing you just have to wait and see to find out about. But that’s always something - at least you have something to look forward to.

Either way; it would be one hell of a bummer to live your whole life believing in life after death, only to find out you were wrong this whole time. So it seems to me that it’s safest to assume that this is all we get. As alpha lobster, Jordan Peterson, eloquently laid out in a lecture: _"You’re all in. Whether you like it or not - this thing will kill you"_. So why not try to make something useful of this thing called life?

## Recognize It Is You Who Is Being Asked

This raises a natural follow-up question: *What the heck should you do?* It is perhaps the most important question any sentient and sufficiently intelligent being could ask oneself. It is also important to acknowledge that “it is we ourselves who must answer the questions that life asks of us” (Victor Frankl). In other words, it is up to you to determine your life’s meaning, since it is you who's being asked.

Unfortunately not very many people give the question serious thought. Most cling to whatever cliché they like the sound of the most given their aggregated experience, such as “follow your passion” or “do what makes you happy”. These are not necessarily bad frameworks, but the point is that most people embrace pre-packaged answers with disinterest in truth.

This unwillingness to ponder might be because the question of what one should do, seems too big for a mortal to ever answer. Some might reason that it’s better then to just pick an answer and get going. Times running out - better not waste any time! This might actually not be such a bad idea.

We’ve all had a moment of realization as adolescents when it truly hit us that these authority figures called adults haven’t really got it all figured out. In fact, most people don’t have any idea of what’s really going on.

If you’re hesitant to believe me, ask the wisest person you know: *“You’re a real smart guy. So I had this little question regarding the very nature of existence. What should one do with one's life - and why?”*. You’ll be lucky if you get even one coherent and - more importantly - original answer. Because any fool can recite the answer given by ideology or another thinker, but to answer for yourself requires more discipline and open-mindedness than most are willing to spare.

## An Algorithm for Figuring Out Life

Considering no one really knows what’s going on, neither what one should do here in life, maybe it’s wisest to just pick a target and get going without thinking too much about what the target should be? To my estimation this is necessary but not sufficient. In order to really figure life out you need to do one more thing: repeated evaluation.

Every time you realize that the target you’ve been aiming for wasn’t that good of a choice (which will be always), you have to be able to change course - and quickly! This willingness to try and err is your best bet for finding truth. The only way to really know something is through direct experience.

But constant iteration isn’t enough either. Since life is limited there is a possibility, though a low probability, that you might never hit the right target before you die. Therefore you also need to be smart about choosing new targets. You have to be able to analyze what was wrong with your previous target and based on that information, choose a new one. It also makes sense to maximize the amount of targets you try since a large sample size improves your ability to evaluate.

We can thus stipulate the following algorithm for figuring life out (math geeks will realize this is analogous to some numerical methods for approximately solving differential equations such as Euler's method):

1. Pick a target
2. Work towards it (for a while)
3. Evaluate
4. Repeat

Now, anyone can pick a target and most can also aim their efforts somewhat but the third step might be easier said than done. How do you objectively evaluate your situation? After all, the easiest person to fool is yourself. You will never reach full objectiveness since your perspective will nevertheless always be a perspective and therefore subjective. But you can improve, and in order to do that you will need a map.

What map you choose will impact your evaluation and therefore also future targets. In other words; the map will fully influence your journey to truth. The choice of map should thus be of highest interest.

When it comes to maps, many different alternatives have been suggested throughout history but only lately have non-religious versions become widespread. Examples of this would be philosophies such as nihilism, hedonism and stoicism.

It is up to each individual to evaluate the helpfulness of different maps but I'd lastly like to present a framework which I personally resonate with. It was first presented to me by Victor Frankl, although the idea far predates him. It goes something along the lines of: *Life is suffering so the only way forward is to transcend it. This can be done by taking on more responsibility and trying to be some kind of hero who makes the suffering in the world less.*

By assigning meaning to each and every action, life will, by definition, become ultimately meaningful.

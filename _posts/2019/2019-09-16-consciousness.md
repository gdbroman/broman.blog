Everyone, including lifelong meditators from time to time, experience a locality of self. That feeling of being inside in one’s skull and looking out through the eyes. This feeling of being geographically located somewhere in space, however, is an illusion - or so I will argue.

_“But I’m right here!”_ might an ego object. And to be clear, the location of one’s _physical body_ is very real - but the location of your _consciousness_ is not. Before further reading, notice that I'm not making any metaphysical claims about consciousness, this is simply a matter of one's first-person experience.

## Sensory Inputs and Their Deception

An important component of human consciousness is input through the five senses and I believe this is the biggest driver of the illusion of consciousness’ locality. Sight, hearing and touch in particular. 

When one uses touch to feel the handle of a coffee mug, one can very easily figure out where that mug is located in space - even without the use of sight. This is no big deal for most organisms. Based on sensory input, the brain subconsciously creates a mental 3D model of the surroundings. Though some are better at this than others. People who have been blind since birth tend to develop an above human average sonar ability, but they in turn pale in comparison to organisms like bats.

Back to the coffee mug. When one perceives the sensory input in the form of touch upon touching the handle it seems like that sensation is located out in space where your hand is making contact with the handle. Just like whenever you have an itch, the locality of it - on your back, say - seems very real indeed. But this, I claim, is simply your mind playing tricks on you. You are confusing the content for the container.

There is nothing about what you sense through touch, listening or sight that has a position. When one figures out where an object is located in space with the help of one or more senses, that is happening through (subconscious) calculation. As previously mentioned, our brains are incredibly good at making sense out of inputs - e.g. it’s what enables you to determine how far away an object is merely by looking at it. But there is nothing in the experience of the visual data itself that has a position. In the same way, the feeling of the coffee mug handle has no position - it is not located anywhere. The only way you are able to determine the mug’s position (without looking) is by sending signals from your somatosensory system (e.g. where the input is coming from and how far out your arm is) to your brain which then interprets that information and outputs a guess of where the mug is located.

Notice the distinction that every bulb throughout your body does have a position whilst the experience of the gathered information does not.

An enlightening example of the illusory nature of sensations is phantom itches. It can occur after amputation of a body part and is when one experiences an itch on an area that is missing and thus cannot be scratched. Phantom itches are indeed a dreadful phenomenon but not very spooky as the name suggests. It is simply a calculation error on the part of the brain. 

Now, realizing that it is a complicated area of research, I’m not trying to oversimplify the diagnose. The point I’m trying to make is simply that whilst some perceptions seem acutely real and out there in the real world, their apparent locality is nonetheless merely products of the mind.

## Thoughts and Their Deception

The non-locality of the other component of consciousness - which I'll call non-input - is, I hope a bit more obvious. With non-input I refer to all experience which is solely internal such as thoughts and moods. Surely, your thoughts and moods can, and many times are, influenced by the external world, but they do not come from the outer world - they arise in your consciousness.

Some might still object that their moods and thoughts are very well located: “They’re inside my head!” But this is a big mistake, one which is probably caused by the earlier discussed, illusory effects of the senses - sight in particular. An effective technique for realizing this mistake of “being inside of one’s head” is to imagine your eyes being located somewhere else on your body. For example, if your eyes, ears and nose were all located on your right shoulder instead - would you still feel like your thoughts were inside your head?

Surely, the physical processes which give rise to the thoughts are located in your brain but the thoughts themselves are not (just like the body has a physical location but the sensory information does not). Moods, however, depending on how you define it, can be felt throughout your body. But this feeling is merely a result of physiological processes such as stomach ache from anxiety and a higher blood pulse from adrenaline. Once again, this is sensory inputs and their deception.

On a personal note, I have understanding for feelings of doubt and weirdness. Everything in our daily lives indicates that we are here, on a definite point in space (which is true depending on if you want to include your body in the definition of your self). And nothing in our daily lives suggests that we are nowhere.

But then again, evolution have only shaped our thinking to understand practical everyday phenomena. It’s only in the last fraction of humanity’s history that we have started to ponder upon abstract questions. No wonder we find quantum mechanics, consciousness and metaphysical topics counterintuitive - the evolution of our brains have not had the time to catch up with our curiosity! In fact, we should thus be surprised if an answer to any of the fundamental questions of life and the universe does make sense to us.

## Practical Implications

Hopefully you are now convinced that your experience - what we might call information since that's all sensory input and thought presumably really is - does not have a position in space. And because the feeling of having a self/I/ego is simply the sum of all experiences, you do not have a position in space. 

In other words, sounds, feelings, thoughts, etc. are all appearing in consciousness which in turn is non-local. All of this, along with noting that you _are_ the consciousness - not its contents - can be a healthy reminder whenever you get caught up in strong emotions or anxiety provoking thoughts.

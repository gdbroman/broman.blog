Social media guru or digital minimalist? 64 pieces of content a day or deep work? 

As a creator; should you listen to Gary Vaynerchuk or Cal Newport?

Before deciding who’s right, let’s quickly try to understand each side.

## Digital whatchacallit?

Cal Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown University but he’s mostly known for writing books such as _Deep Work_ and _Digital Minimalism_. 

The gist of these books is that focused, quality work is becoming increasingly rare in our digital, distracted society.

Because of this; if you can get good at, so called, deep work, you’ll get ahead of the distracted competition and thrive in today’s economy as an intellectual worker.

Just like minimalism is about distilling life to what actually matters — digital minimalism is about not wasting time on social media and focusing on creating value.

## Puting out content!

Gary Vaynerchuk on the other hand preaches _“day trading attention”_. To be everywhere all the time. To get as many eyeballs on you and/or your product as possible.

**Vaynerchuk’s strategy is essentially about building a brand by taking up as much digital space as possible.**

## Quality vs. Quantity

At a first glance, it might seem like Newport is all about quality and Vaynerchuk all about quantity. On some level I think that’s true but really they’re both about quality — they’ve just decided upon different strategies based on their specific work and personality types.

Newport’s day job is being a researcher so naturally his work requires more deep work.

Vaynerchuk on the other hand is a CEO who has to be able to quickly solve problems. Because of his hectic working environment, his attention will naturally be more scattered. It’s what works given his circumstances.

At the end of the day, they’re both applying the Ceramics Teacher’s lesson on quantity over quality in the ultimate pursuit of quality. Vaynerchuk is still focused on creating value but his role as a marketer naturally has a more spray and pray-approach.

## Marketing vs. Value Creation — Sometimes Hard to Separate

This discussion ultimately boils down to marketing vs. value creation. But their distinction is not always obvious.

For example, if you’re an influencer of sorts; it’s not entirely clear where the line between marketing and value creation lies.

If you’re putting out educational content through blogging; then you’re simultaneously creating value and building your own brand.

## Not Necessarily Exclusive

At the end of the day, you’ll most likely need to utilize both strategies.

How much of each depends on your work and personality type. This requires awareness.

Do you thrive as a silent thinker or outgoing promoter? What is most important for your type of work?

If you’re an author, you will need long stretches of time packed with intense deep work followed by periods of promotion via digital marketing.

Look at Newport — though he’s known for his laser focus as an author — he’s still marketing his brand through frequent blogging.

So, to wrap this up: who should you listen to — Garyvee or Newport? Just pick one that fits your style and get going!

But most likely you're not a CEO of a multimillion-dollar company and can afford bigger blocks of interrupted time.

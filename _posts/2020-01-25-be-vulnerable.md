That's James Altucher on being a good storyteller. But his advice applies to more areas than just writing. Because living a meaningful life is, in a way, like telling a good story. Let me elaborate.

On birth you embark on a journey. Initially you lack a final destination, so you seek purpose to make it worthwhile. Analogous to an author trying to make a story exciting, finding meaning becomes a main motivation. Some find it, many don't.

In Man's Search for Meaning, psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl states that there're three ways of finding meaning in life.

1. By creating a work or doing a deed
2. By experiencing something or encountering someone (love)
3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering

I bring this up because all three are encapsulated in the preluding quote. Altucher's philosophy on writing therefore seems to carry some merit.

By writing something that makes you vulnerable, you (1) create, (2) experience something thrilling and (3) embrace unavoidable suffering (other's judgements). No wonder writing can feel so meaningful!

## Heroic suffering
How does this apply to non-writing? As Frankl said, creation is not the only path to meaning. The other option is through love. And the third way is through heroic suffering. The latter is how Frankl himself managed to go through Auschwitz and what Atlucher was hinting at in the interview.

Heroic suffering means accepting that life is suffering. It means taking on full responsibility for all your actions. Both your failures and successes. This is scary. But it's also meaningful. Because when everything you do matters - per definition - you will live a meaningful life. It's the ultimate form of vulnerability.

## Being yourself

Being vulnerable is not exclusively about meaning. It will also make you seem more trustworthy as well as enabling you to connect with others on a deeper level. But most importantly it will connect you with your true self.

Lastly, "be vulnerable" is much more helpful advice than "be yourself". They both point at the same thing but the former is more practical, and a easier to implement tip, than the latter.

Be vulnerable.

This is a short book summary of Zero to One by Peter Thiel which is about startups and innovation. I highly recommend reading it to those with entrepreneurial ambitions.

### Brief Background

In 1999, Peter Thiel co-founded the online payment-company 
PayPal which later was sold to eBay for 1.5 billion dollars. The company's founders, including Elon Musk, have later become known as the "Paypal Mafia" since they all later started billion dollar companies such as Tesla Motors, LinkedIn, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies, Youtube and Yelp. It's in other words a group of overachieving innovators and entrepreneurs. And since Thiel was CEO for this unique group of people during PayPal's early days, he probably knows a thing or two about business.

Thiel's view on today's innovation is that it's merely a form of incrementalism. In other words that most technology is getting better through small, incremental improvements - what he calls from 1 to n. He suggests that innovation - going from 0 to 1 - is rare in today's world but seeks to inspire through his book Zero to One.

## #1 Monopolies Are Desirable

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).

Mark Twain
Most people today subscribe to the notion that competition is essential for capitalism. Thiel, on the other hand, couldn't agree less: "Competition is for losers". He states that capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is about maximizing profit whereas competition eliminates it (or at least decreases it). The key to success in value creation is thus to avoid competition at all costs.

### But aren't monopolies evil?

But aren't monopolies evil? Some of them, yes. This is obviously why most people (or at least consumers) shy away from the idea of eliminating competition.

But here's the thing: most monopolies today are not evil but instead valuable assets to the world. Take Google as an example which has a monopoly on search engines. If that wasn't the case and instead they had to focus on beating a competitor such as Bing everyday - do you think they would have the resources to focus on altruistic projects such as free internet for everyone, Google Maps and self-driving cars?

### Small Niche First, Global Domination Second

It's hopefully clear that you can't achieve global domination over night. Instead, Thiel strongly proposes trying to occupy a small niche market first.

Jeff Bezos for instance, had the idea of building an "everything store" - which he also achieved with Amazon, but it didn't start out that way. Instead, Bezos began dominating a much smaller niche, namely: books.

Books are small, lightweight and for the most part all the same size which make them easy to ship. Furthermore, readers are an ideal market since they tend to be well educated and this high spending power.

Because Bezos successfully occupied a niche market he generated enough cash flow and a robust enough infrastructure to later scale the business by introducing new product lines such as CDs and DVDs.

The lesson here is that when you start your first company, you don't wanna try to occupy 1% of a huge market. Try to get 80% of a smaller one instead. This is because you will have more control.

There are four main ways to achieving monopoly within your industry and they can be demonstrated by the following companies.

* Apple: the brand
    * Be the first and only brand that people come to think of in a market
* Google: technology
    * Why do most people use Google instead of Bing? Because their technology (the search algorithm) is 10 times better.
* Facebook: network effect
    * Why do you use Facebook or Instagram instead of new social media platforms? Because your friends are on these networks. More people using a network decreases the chance of people moving.
* Amazon: economy of scale
    * Amazon can offer free shipping on heavy goods because of the scale benefits of shipping huge amounts.

## #2 Successful Businesses are Based on Secrets

> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

> <cite>Peter Thiel</cite>

The best path to monopoly is with the help of a secret. Thiel grants that there probably are many things to focus on if you want to create value but what he focuses a lot on is trying to do something no one else is doing, or as he puts it: "Bet on a contrarian truth". Steve Jobs understood very early that we would use smartphones in the future and that we wouldn't need physical keyboards but almost no on agreed with him back then. Uber and Airbnb betted on the absurd chance that we in the future would be willing to step into strangers cars and sleep in strangers houses.

One of his last famous questions Thiel usually asks in hiring interviews is "tell me something true which very few people agree with you on". And the business variant of that for founders becomes "what successful company is no one building right now?" The answer to this question is a truth about how people will behave in the future and which we are not willing to see or admit today.

> Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.

You do not want to start the 20th dog food e-company, the 12th solar panel company or another San Francisco restaurant. But if you do something that no one has done before, you have a unique opportunity to create a monopoly, which, as we already discussed, is how you succeed as an entrepreneur.

## #3 Be Different

Just as you want to create a unique company you also want to strive towards being unique yourself. Sadly, we are shaped into conformists early in school.

> Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of being turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?
> 
> <cite>Peter Thiel</cite>

Those who were visionaries in high school get their dreams crushed at university and instead tell themselves that they want to become an investment banker or consultant.

Thiel points out the role of imitation in our lives. The word "ape", for instance, means both primate and to imitate. It suggests that imitation is something fundamentally human: it's how we learn new languages and how culture is transmitted. But at the same time, imitation is the reason behind a lot of negative behavior such as economic bubbles and Madness of Crowds.

He also advocates focusing on picking a few specific skills and mastering them. This is a bit contrary to what Warren Buffett says about reading widely to know a little bit about everything. But to be fair; they aren't completely diametrically opposite advise since you can be an expert and still be widely educated.

Lastly, Thiel emphasizes that success is not about luck. He denies Malcom Gladwell's thesis in The Outliers that success mostly depends on being in the right place at the right time. He admits that these are important factors - indeed necessary - but no billion dollar company has been created with mere luck.

## Closing Remark

These three valuable tips by Thiel are in a way all saying the same thing: be unique. Or, as an old legendary marketing slogan once said: Think Different.

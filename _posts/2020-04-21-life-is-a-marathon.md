Hit by a bus. Tomorrow. It could happen.

Though thanks to technology, you might live to be well over a hundred.

How do you reconcile these? Do you live in the moment - or, suffer now, for a better long term future?

Maybe it's possible to be present and strive for a better future?

Or maybe not. It seems naive. I don't know.

But here's my fear: planning for the future so much that I forget how to live in the present moment. How to be.

Forgetting how to be a human BEing - not DOing.

I would consider that a kind of death.

Actually a worse kind of death than getting hit by a bus.

Because you'd still physically be there, although you wouldn't.

Just like someone getting alzheimers. You can see it's them, yet you don't recognize the person.

I'd choose the bus any day.

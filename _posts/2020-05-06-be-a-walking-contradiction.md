Ideology is probably among the biggest traps in life. Partly because of how widespread it is.

It does not only permeate politics and religion; you also find it in science, academia and about every other industry there is.

So what is ideology exactly? According to Wikipedia, it's simply a set of beliefs. And what’s a belief? An attitude that something is true - without necessarily knowing that’s the case, let’s say.

Lastly, one would naturally ask: What do we know? And many would answer that we know “lots of things”. But that’s being ideological as far as I’m concerned.

Because if you truly study epistemology, you’ll discover that we don’t know shit. Actually, that’s not true. We know one thing. That there’s something going on. Something which we call the universe. But that’s it.

This inevitably leads us to the conclusion that our lives are filled with beliefs - conveniently covering up the uncertainties. The vast majority of us are thus highly ideological people.

Maybe I’m even being ideological right now? It’s certainly possible considering the blinding effect ideology has on your self-awareness.

But how do you know someone’s being ideological? Here’s a quick test: Can you predict someone’s answers to a whole set of unrelated questions with a high probability given that you know their stance on just one question? If so, that’s not a free thinking individual you’re talking with. That’s a mouthpiece.

So what’s the alternative?

Radical open mindedness. Questioning everything. Including open mindedness. To approach every question with your mind as a blank slate.

If you do this, you’ll eventually become a walking contradiction. All of your ideas will have been independently derived. And good for you! Now you’re actually an interesting human being.

Because that’s how humans are. That’s how humans should be, rather.

We’re seldom only happy or solely sad. We’re both happy and sad. Cheerful and miserable.

Try being an intellectual and a meathead. Spiritual but not religious. Disciplined but rebellious. Respectful and independent. Uncertain but well-read.

The point is not the properties themselves but the superposition of them. The harder it is to intellectually put you in a box and slap a label on, the better.

And if that’s the case, congratulations - you’re a free thinker.

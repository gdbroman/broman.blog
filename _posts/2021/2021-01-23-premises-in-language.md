Wherever we go, there we are, there our problems are. Fundamentally, wherever we go, the same people are. But our ways of sameness differ, and we see this in language.

Language shapes our thinking - yes, this we know - but also thinking shapes our language. So I think differences in language are symptomatic of differences in being, rather than some separate thing in itself.  Language is the most contextual invention there is - being being the premise.

Everyday expressions - because of their effective abstractionality - unfortunately shield off clarity for important areas of thought requiring more first-principle thinking. They're seeming qualitative statements that only reveal themselves as normative at a closer look. E.g. “airing one’s dirty laundry in public” implies a badness of vulnerability through sharing, and this particular saying - which happens to be used by boomers - reflects their valuing of privacy.

The more fundamental the area of inquiry, the more words muddy the water. Obviously! since any abstraction has to quickly rise out the mud in order to be useful. So by "merely" communicating we ignore all questions we'd only consider meaningful at a preverbal state. So sometimes, the best we can say is nothing at all.

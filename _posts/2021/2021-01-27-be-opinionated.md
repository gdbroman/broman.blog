A quick bad decision is better than no decision - at least it is quick. A wrong belief held strongly is better than being loosely correct - at least it is strong. Reclaim responsibility for what you think!

Open-minded is not the same as spineless. Rather be proven wrong, than not at all. Have convictions, or you can’t win (nor know when you’re wrong and need to rethink). Without a goal we can’t score kind-of-a-thing.

Not hedging your opinions is also more fun. Comedians are well aware of this, and some use it as a gimmick. For instance, everyone gets that Bill Burr is not *actually* misogynistic when he shits on feminism or whatever.

Nuance is boring and unnecessary. People who use *“some,”* *“maybe”,* and *“potentially,”* in each sentence and preamble their opinions with *"it seems like,"* or *"my current mental model for this is,"* are just boring to be around. It’s already implied that you’re open to being proven wrong if you’re a decent human being. If we’re always hedging what we’re saying we’re never really saying anything.

And when unsure of how to feel about something, always go where you’re the least expected. Go into spaces you shouldn’t go into. Be the master. Seek the weird, bizarre, and esoteric. Going against the crowd increases the potential for an interesting life.

Values. What about them?

A value we often come across is *"to not care what others think of us."* It is such embarrassingly deceitful advice - contradicting the most primal of human drives - that it often flies under the radar, undetected by our lizard brain, tricking Mr. Narcissistic Neocortex into thinking he actually possesses this kind of power.

Not that it is *bad* advice, but that it assumes people care in the first place. Which they do - about themselves! Especially when their manners are hurtful and appear directed towards us.

By caring for other's opinions - the emotional baggage that's feeding them - and not desperately shushing them away as a threat, we're freed from their personal grip on us.

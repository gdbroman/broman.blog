Values. What about them? Interpretation is all.

A value we often come across is *"to not care what others think of us."* This is such embarrassingly unrealistic advice - contradicting the most primal of human drives - that it flies undetected by our lizard brain, tricking Mr. Narcissistic Neocortex into thinking he actually possesses that kind of power.

Not that it is *bad* advice, but that it assumes people care in the first place. They do. About themselves! Especially when their manners hurtful and appear directed towards us.

By caring for other's opinions - the emotional baggage that's feeding them - not desperately shushing them away, we are freed from their personal grip on us.

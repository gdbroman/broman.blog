Whenever someone says *"I'm an aspiring X",* it's time to get a bit wary. It's a sign that X is probably something they shouldn't do. That they place value on the label - or are trying to signal their *valuing of* the label - as supposed to the craft itself.

I think we tend to know what we're meant to do, it's just that sometimes we don't like the answer. The real answer is often uncomfortable - maybe not as convenient as we'd hoped. So we replace it with something more culturally hip.

But even if X truly is what you want do, I still think the aspiring-thing is toxic. Obviously, it is well-intentioned: By calling yourself an "aspiring" something, youâ€™re signaling humility and self-awareness. But we seldom achieve aspirations with our eyes fixed on the label.

And although ubiquitous, label-anxiety seems peculiarly prevalent in creative fields, where qualifications are vague. Never would anyone say they're an "aspiring MD" - you either are one, or *get away from the operating table!*

But at the end of the day, what does it matter what your passion is called? If it makes you happy, *do it now!* Picasso couldn't have cared less if you called him a painter, sculptor, or artist. He just did his thing.

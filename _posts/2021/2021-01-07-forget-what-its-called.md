Language gives rise to so much suffering. Instead of being an "aspiring writer," just write! Instead of wanting to become a musician, play. *Do it now!*

The aspirational tic seems to be particularly common in creative fields, where qualifications are vague. Never would anyone say they're an "aspiring MD" - you either are one, or *get away from the operating table!*

Obviously, it is well-intentioned. Youâ€™re signaling humility and self-awareness. But it's also a tell that you place value on the label, as supposed to the craft itself. And we seldom achieve aspirations with our eyes fixed on the label.

Picasso couldn't have cared less if you called him a painter, sculptor, or artist. He just did his thing.

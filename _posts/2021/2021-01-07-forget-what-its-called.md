Whenever someone says *"I'm an aspiring X",* it's a tell that X is probably something they shouldn't do. It tells you that they place value on the label, as supposed to the craft itself.

I think we tend to know what we're meant to do, it's just that sometimes we don't like the answer. The real answer is often uncomfortable. Maybe it's not as convenient and culturally hip as you'd like.

But even if X truly is what you want do, I still think the "aspiring" thing is toxic. Obviously, it is well-intentioned. By calling yourself an aspiring something, youâ€™re signaling humility and self-awareness. But we seldom achieve aspirations with our eyes fixed on the label.

And although ubiquitous, this language-block seems extra strong in creative fields, where qualifications are vague. Never would anyone say they're an "aspiring MD" - you either are one, or *get away from the operating table!*

But what does it matter what it's called? Instead of being an "aspiring writer," just write! Instead of wanting to become a "musician," play. *Do your thing now!*

Picasso couldn't have cared less if you called him a painter, sculptor, or artist. He just did his thing.

Whenever someone says *"I'm an aspiring X",* it's time to get a bit wary. It's a sign that X is probably something they shouldn't do. That they place value on the label - or are trying to signal their *valuing of* the label - as supposed to the craft itself.

I think we tend to know what we're supposed to do, it's just that sometimes we don't like the answer. The real answer is often uncomfortable - inconvenient, and maybe not as trendy as we'd hoped. So we replace it with something more culturally accepted.

But even if X truly is what you want do, the aspiring-thing is still toxic. Obviously, it is well-intentioned: By calling yourself an "aspiring" something, youâ€™re signaling humility, self-awareness, and ambition - all whilst getting to prematurely cash out on the label. Kind of saying, *this is where I want to be, though I acknowledge I'm not quite there yet*. However, we seldom achieve aspirations with our eyes fixed on the label.

And although ubiquitous, label anxiety seems particularly prevalent in creative fields, where qualifications are vague. Never would anyone say they're an "aspiring MD" - you either are one, or *get away from the operating table!*

But at the end of the day, what does it matter what your passion is called? If it makes you happy, *do it now!* Picasso couldn't have cared less if you called him a painter, sculptor, or artist. He just did his thing.

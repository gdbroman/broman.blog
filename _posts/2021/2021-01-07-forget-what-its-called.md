Whenever someone says *"I'm an aspiring X",* it's time to grow seriously sceptical. It's a tell that X is probably something they should *not* do; that they place value on the label - or are trying to signal their *valuing of* the label - as supposed to the craft itself.

I think we tend to know what we're supposed to do. It's just that sometimes we don't like the answer. Oftentimes, the real answer is uncomfortably inconvenient, and maybe not as trendy as we'd like. So we replace it with something more culturally accepted.

But even if X *truly is* what you want to do in life, the aspiring-thing is still dysfunctional. *Because what are you doing?* Youâ€™re signaling self-awareness by acknowledging how you're not yet where you want to be, whilst ironically being unaware of the fact that this is what you are actually doing. It tries to signal ambition by prematurely cashing out on the label's brand value, which is really more greedy than it is ambitious. And it is an attempt at signaling humility through the previously mentioned, halting self-awareness, but to no avail! since calling yourself something before you're it, is the opposite of humility - no matter the prefix. But setting all of this doublethink aside, the fact that we seldom achieve aspirations with our eyes fixed on the label, should be enough of a reason to keep us out of this signaling mess.

Label anxiety seems particularly prevalent in creative fields, where qualifications are vague. Never would anyone call themselves an "aspiring MD" - you either are one, or *get away from the operating table!* Whereas the labels "actor," "painter," and "musician" are a lot more ambivalent. But here lies freedom! Why call yourself an "aspiring writer" when you can just write?

At the end of the day, what does it matter what it is called? I say, if it makes you happy, *do it now!* Picasso couldn't have cared less if we called him a painter, sculptor, or artist. He just did his thing.

Whenever someone says *"I'm an aspiring X,"* it should call for skepticality: It's a tell that X is probably something they should *not* do; that the person places value on the label - or the *valuing of* the label, etc. - as supposed to the craft itself.

I think we always know what we're supposed to do. It's just that sometimes we don't like the answer. Oftentimes, the real answer is uncomfortably inconvenient, and maybe not as trendy as we'd hoped. So we replace it with something more culturally acceptable.

But even if X is one's life purpose, aspirational signaling remains dysfunctional. *Because what are you doing?* You demonstrate a level of self-awareness required for acknowledging how you're not yet where you seek to be, whilst ironically not being self-aware enough to realize this is what you're doing. It tries to signal ambition by capitalizing on the label's brand value, which is really more greedy than it is ambitious. And it's an attempt at signaling humility through the previously mentioned, halting self-awareness, but to no avail! since premature declaration is the opposite of humility - no matter the prefix. But all doublethink aside, the fact is we seldom achieve aspirations with our eyes fixed on labels; this should be enough reason to stay out of signaling-hell.

Label anxiety seems particularly prevalent in creative fields, where qualifications are vague. Never would anyone call themselves an "aspiring MD" - you either are one, or *get away from the operating table!* Whereas the labels "actor," "painter," and "musician" are a lot more ambivalent. But here lies freedom! Why call yourself an "aspiring writer" when you can just write?

Language sure causes great trouble for supposedly being among our proudest inventions. At the end of the day, what does it matter what it is called? I say, if it makes you happy, do it now. Picasso couldn't have cared less if you called him a painter, sculptor, or artist. He just did his thing.

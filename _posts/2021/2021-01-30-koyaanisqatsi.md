How come who is tightest integrated in the uncaring machine is prettiest of all? Suit or dress, a combed hair, perfume and makeup, hyperhygienic and orderly? I think this is a devilish beauty. The devil does not come dressed in pointy horns, but as all our wishes. The overinsistence on orderliness - and obsessive cleanliness - shows a hatred for life - imbalance! is how you recognize evil. The obedient student, the impeccable executive, the larger than life religious leader. I was the most productive I've ever been during emotional sickness.

It is uncaring because it disregards personal flourishment, and it is a machine because it lacks a heart. *Does it make you feel alive?* Then it is living. But most work does not make us feel alive and is therefore not living. Let this be a reminder that yes you are a cog, and it is your obligation to set yourself free. That whilst enslaved, there is hope; every day people are liberated from the machine's suffocating grip.

Real beauty is balanced. Real beauty is in the form of an adventurous journeyer, a rebellious pirate or forceful warrior - more disorderly than the worker. Long hair, tanned muscles, a bit sandy, in leather shorts on the beach. Living fully, but not in total chaos like the homeless. Beauty is found in the balance between order and disorder.

How to become free? Brisk walks and loud laughs. Fast runs, a light heart. Stare in the sun; color, light - light and love. Nature shouts, can't you hear? *Come and get me!* seek adventure; mysteries and wonders everywhere. Philosophy should invigorate, not be dead and dry like school. Invite deeper breaths, seeking and striving. Life is complex but living is easy. The hill - climb over it. There! what's over there? Curiosity, yes; but also now. Right here, right now.

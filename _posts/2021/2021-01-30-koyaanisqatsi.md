How come who is tightest integrated in the uncaring machine is prettiest of all? Suit or dress, a combed hair; perfume and makeup, hygienic and orderly? It's a devilish beauty. The devil doesn't come dressed in pointy horns, but as all our wishes. The insistence on order and obsessive sanitation - it shows a hatred for life. Imbalance! is how you recognize evil. The obedient student, overpromising projects, the impeccable guru. I was the most productive I've ever been during emotional sickness.

It is uncaring because it interferes with individual flourishment, and it is a machine because it lacks a heart. _Does it make you feel alive?_ Then it is living. But most work does not make us feel alive and is therefore not living. Living is about _feeling_ alive, not merely surviving. Let this be a reminder that yes you are a cog, and it is your obligation to set yourself free. That whilst enslaved, hope persists; every day people escape the suffocating grip.

Real beauty is balance. Real beauty is in the form of an adventurous pirate or forceful warrior - more disorderly than the worker. Salty hair; muscles tanned, and sandy feet. Living fully, yet not in anarchy. Beauty is found in between.

How to be free? Brisk walks and loud laughs. Fast runs and a lighter heart. Stares in the sun; color, light - light and love. Nature shouts, can't you hear? _Come and get me! Seek me out!_ Adventure. Mystery and miracle everywhere. Philosophy should invigorate, not drain and deaden like school. To invite deeper breaths, seeking and striving. Life is hard but living is easy. The hill - climb it over. _Whatâ€™s over there?_ Curiosity, yes; but it is also here. Right now it is here.

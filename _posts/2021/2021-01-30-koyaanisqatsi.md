How come who is tightest integrated in the uncaring machine is who looks the prettiest? Suit or dress, a combed hair, perfume and makeup, hyperhygienic and orderly? I think this is a devilish beauty. The devil does not come dressed in pointy horns, he comes as everything we ever wished for. The overinsistence on orderliness and obsessive cleanliness shows a hatred for life - imbalance! is how you recognize evil. The obedient student, the impeccable executive, the larger than life religious leader. I was the most productive I've ever been during emotional sickness.

It is uncaring because it disregards your personal flourishment and it is a machine because it lacks heart. *Does it make you feel alive?* Then it is living! But most work does not make us feel alive and is therefore not living. Let this be a reminder that yes you are a cog, and it is your obligation to set yourself free. That whilst enslaved there is hope; people set themselves free every day.

Real beauty is balanced. Real beauty is in the form of an adventurous journeyer, a rebellious pirate or forceful warrior - more disorderly than the worker. Long hair, tanned muscles, a bit sandy in leather shorts on the beach. Living fully, but not in total chaos like the homeless. Beauty is found in the balance between order and disorder.

Brisk walks and loud laughs. Fast runs, a light heart, stare in the sun. Color, light, love. Nature is shouting, can't you hear? *Come and get me! seek adventure;* mysteries and wonders everywhere. Philosophy is supposed to invigorate, not be dead and dry like in school. To invite deeper breaths, seeking and striving. Life is complex but living is easy. The hill - climb over it - there! what's on the other side? Curiosity, yes. But also now. Right now, right here.

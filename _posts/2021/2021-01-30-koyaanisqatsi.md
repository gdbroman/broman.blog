How come who is tightest integrated in the uncaring machine is prettiest of all? Suit or dress, a combed hair; perfume and makeup, hygienic and orderly? It's a devilish beauty. The devil doesn't come dressed in pointy horns, he comes as all our wishes. The insistence on order and obsessive sanitation - it shows a hatred for life. Imbalance! - is how you recognize evil. The obedient student, overpromising projects, the impeccable guru. I was the most productive I've ever been during emotional sickness.

It is uncaring because it interferes personal flourishment, and it is a machine because it lacks a heart. *Does it make you feel alive?* Then it is living. But most work does not make us feel alive and is therefore not living. Living is about feeling alive, not merely surviving. Let this be a reminder that yes you are a cog, and it is your obligation to set yourself free. That whilst enslaved, hope persists; every day people are liberated from the suffocating grip.

Real beauty is balance. Real beauty is in the form of an adventurous journeyer, a rebellious pirate or forceful warrior - more disorderly than the worker. Salty hair; muscles tanned, and sandy feet. Living fully, but not in total chaos like the homeless. Beauty is found in the balance between order and disorder.

How to be free? Brisk walks and loud laughs. Fast runs and a light heart. Stares in the sun; color and light - light and love. Nature shouts, can't you hear? *Come and get me!* seek adventure; mysteries and wonders everywhere. Philosophy should invigorate, not drain and deaden like school. Invite deeper breaths, seeking and striving. Life is complex but living is easy. The hill - climb it over. What's over there? Curiosity, yes; but it is also here. Right now, right here.

Desperately trying to stay afloat, we grab on to anything that postpones the ever-pressing question which patiently awaits us in silent darkness on the ocean floor.

Knowing we cannot kick forever, some anxiously start to wonder what it is that is waiting? Realizing that one day, we too, will - whether we want to or not - in battle or resignation - have to let go, and confront our situation.

There are two types; those who sleep in light, and those who awake in darkness. Most reject death before death and so they die cowards having never lived. Terrified of what lingers in the crevasses of one's own mind, we respond to boredom, solitude, and tragedy, by pressing buttons, swiping cards, and chewing corn. Reflexively reaching for water whenever the flavor grows too strong.

I, too, have been fleeing - all the while naively thinking of myself as having an interest in this question of being, but only now realizing my deceit. Only now dipping my toes in the existential silence and its accompanying discomfort. Albeit with a new faith, that love awaits on the other side.

In the end, we all are - and, as can be realized, always *were* - alone. On the other side - then, or now - we shall see.

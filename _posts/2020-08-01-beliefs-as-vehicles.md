The default is to be a vessel for other people’s ideas. The goal should be for the ideas to become your vessels.

You don’t want to become the disinterested academic, treating all ideas as interchangeable. Not able to discern the profound from the ordinary, nor able to embody it when you do.

At the same time; recognize that beliefs are vehicles.

The brain is not stupid. **Every belief exists because it served us well at some point in our life. Most often as a defense mechanism against chaos.**

But eventually we have to say, "that belief was just a vehicle. It served its purpose - but it was just a vehicle."

_Where’s the next paradigm? What’s the next vehicle?_

It’s like clothing. Every type of outfit has its unique time and place. Wear an outfit for too long and it gets stinky.

Alternatively: you wouldn’t try to put on the same clothes you wore ten years ago or you’d be embarrassed! And they probably wouldn’t fit.

One can still wear beliefs with comfort and style - whilst stoically detached. 

Remembering, that at any moment - and realizing _there will be such a moment_ - you can take off your shoes and walk away, in search of new ones.

Balance: Is it a lie?

One’s time and mental energy - whilst more abundant than most probably think - is, undeniably limited.

Each day you’re handed a certain amount of fuel units and it’s your job to spend them wisely with respect to your short- and long term goals.

Once again, you can increase those fuel units through lifestyle design. But no matter how much meditating and fasted exercise you do, there’ll always be 24 hours in a day.

Everybody gets 24 hours.

So what’s your strategy? Balance or focus?

Because you only get to have one - or maybe two - spikes. Each hour you spend on activity X could be an hour spent on activity Y.

Ideally you choose your spikes synergistically. Such as how physical exercise empowers you to get more done in your career or business.

But other times you’ll have to let something go. It may be a hobby very dear to your heart, but you recognize that it is taking away resources that you could spend on getting to your ultimate goal.

So if you seek balance, life’s a juggling act.

But if you seek focused progress, life’s a narrow road of sacrifices.

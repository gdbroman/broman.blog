Balance: Is it a lie?

One’s time and mental energy - whilst more abundant than most probably think - is, undeniably limited.

Each day we’re handed a certain amount of fuel units and it’s up to ourselves to spend them wisely with respect to our short- and long term goals.

Indeed, we can increase those fuel units through lifestyle design. But no matter how much meditating and fasted exercise one does, there’ll always be 24 hours in a day.

_Everybody_ gets 24 hours.

So what’s your strategy gonna be like? Balance or focus?

Because you only get to have one spike. Each hour you spend on activity A, could be an hour spent on B.

There's _always_ an opportunity cost.

Ideally you choose your habits synergistically. So that they empower each other.

But other times you’ll have to let something go. 

It may be a hobby very dear to your heart, but which you recognize is eating up valuable time, so you have to let it go.

Seek balance, and life’s a juggling act.

Seek focus, and it's a narrow road of sacrifice.

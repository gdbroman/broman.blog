_What things would be worth mastering in spite of the ever-changing technology-based and knowledge-based economy of today?_

It’s a helpful question for pre-screening what skills to learn.

Math, physics, philosophy; these are safe bets since what they’re studying - reality - is not changing any time soon.

You could call them _eternal skills_.

But also sales, history, psychology and human behaviour as long as you’re learning established fundamentals and not the “hip theory of the day”.

These skills on the other hand: computer programs, gossip and search engine optimization - should not be as high a priority due to their short life expectancy.

Let’s call them _momentary skills_.

Now, I’m not saying you should _never_ learn stuff only because it will become obsolete some day. Because almost all jobs require momentary skills on some level. 

Excel in accounting, hip frameworks in programming, social media strategies in marketing, etcetera.

So you need to learn a few, key momentary skills to land a job, but never let it become your highest priority. The rest of your time should be spent on learning eternal skills. Or you’ll become replaceable.

**Your effort spent learning something should be a function of it’s estimated expiration date.**

Momentary skills land you a job. Eternal skills make you free.

_What things would be worth mastering in spite of the ever-changing technology-based and knowledge-based economy of today?_

It’s a helpful question for pre-screening what skills to learn.

Math, physics, philosophy; these are safe bets since their object of study is not changing any time soon.

You could call them _eternal skills_.

But also history, sales, psychology and human behaviour - as long as you’re learning established fundamentals and not the “hip theory of the day”.

On the flip side we have computer programs, news, and social media. These should not be as high a priority due to their shorter life expectancy.

Let us call them _momentary skills_.

Now, I’m not saying one should _never_ learn that which will become obsolete. Because almost all jobs require you do: Excel in accounting, hip frameworks in programming, social media strategies in marketing, etcetera.

You could also make the case that _all_ skills are momentary, if you consider AGI. But that's neither here nor there.

If you seek freedom, your effort spent learning something should be a function of it’s estimated expiration date.

In other words, learn a few, key momentary skills to land a job, but never let it become your highest priority. Spend the rest of your time learning eternal skills, or you’ll become a replaceable slave.

Momentary skills land you a job, eternal skills make you free.

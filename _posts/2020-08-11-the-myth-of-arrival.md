We seek completion yet there is none.

We anticipate arrival but it’s always forgone.

No destination, and never will be.

An everlasting journey, is all there could be!

Depressing? Grudging?

You do the judging.

We make our own meaning, don’t you see?

Suffering we can transcend.

But never forget: there isn't an end.

It may be absurd, perhaps make you vengeful.

But ultimately, there's nothing more meaningful.

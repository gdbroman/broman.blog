What makes good writing?

Here’s poet Charles Bukowski’s answer in an interview:

> Bim bim bim.
> 
> Bim bim bim!

He suggests communication should be molecular.

Every paragraph, sentence and word able to stand on its own.

Bukowski complains about how most writers are boring. That they’re mistakenly writing without the reader in mind.

How every sentence should capture your attention.

So if it’s not interesting, delete it.

Humans are story driven creatures. 

No matter your pursuits, you'll need to master the art of storytelling. It's the only skill there is.

Making money, building companies and sales is storytelling. 

Art and politics is storytelling, obviously.

I would even argue that *science and technology* is storytelling. Yes, really; stories about reality.

As long as you’re in the materialistic paradigm, it’s all stories.

So whenever there’s friction or frustration don't give up on storytelling altogether - seek a *better* story!

And you can decide what stories to subscribe to. At any moment, you can become a story*teller*. 

What stories will you tell?

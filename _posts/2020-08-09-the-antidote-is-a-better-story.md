Humans are story driven creatures. 

No matter your pursuits, you'll need to master the art of storytelling. It's the only skill there is.

Making money and building companies is storytelling. 

All kind of art - and politics - is *definitely* storytelling.

I would even argue that *science and technology* is storytelling. Yes, really; stories about reality.

As long as you’re in the materialistic paradigm, it’s all stories.

So whenever there’s friction or stagnation don't give up on storytelling altogether - seek a better story!

You can decide what stories to subscribe to. And at any moment, **if the present stories don't cut it, you can become a story*teller*.** 

What stories will you tell?

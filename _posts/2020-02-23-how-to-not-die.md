To go through a full adult life - conscious, without inwardly dying. That - David Foster Wallace said - is the real value of a liberal arts education.

But let's adress the elephant in the room. Wallace committed suicide in his late forties [1]. So should you separate the artist from his work or not? I choose to leave that for another time.

Instead, consider Alain de Botton's take:
> I was a dutiful student when I went to school and then university.
> 
> I wanted to please my parents and tick all the boxes.
> 
> But I also knew that if you did that your whole life long, that would be the equivalent to being dead.

He continues.

> There's a time for submitting to authority and for complying but there is also a time for strategic rebellion.

In other words: if you live life fully based on someone else's goals or ideals (such as your parents' or society's) you will ultimately end up feeling dead inside. Empty. Because you're not living you.

The solution, then, is to strategically rebel against conventions and others expectations. This is a necessity. Your north star and the path it illuminates, will never fully align with that of another.

Obviously, there is no disrespect intended here, whatsoever. It's impossible to know the cause of his long lived depression, so I'm not claiming anything about his life philosophy's role in that.

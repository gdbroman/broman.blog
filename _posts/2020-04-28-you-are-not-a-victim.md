The absolute worst thing you can do to someone is to rob them of their responsibility. To convince them of being a victim. Regardless of its level of truth.

That it’s not their fault. That they’re a result of circumstances outside of their control.

This way of thinking shuts down your mind and extinguishes the human spirit.

And to think in terms of fairness - whether the world is just or not - does not help either.

Indeed, the world probably is unfair. And you probably are a victim. But where does that conclusion take you? Backwards into a hole of despair if anywhere.

No, instead one can try to take on ultimate responsibility. Because you are NOT a victim.

Did your project not turn out as you wanted? There’s no one to blame but you.

Overweight? That’s on you.

Your team lost? You.

Because if one does not embrace this black-and-white mindset with utmost confidence - and instead try to draw a line between what are one’s responsibilities versus not - one will inevitably regress back into a victim mentality.

Obviously one cannot control the weather or macroeconomical circumstances. To focus on what you can control is still an important lesson for mental clarity.

Though for many, that circle of responsibility is far smaller than it could, and probably should be.

It is through biting of more than we can chew that we discover our true capabilities.

People fear discovering their limits - but is there anything more tragic than unrealized potential?

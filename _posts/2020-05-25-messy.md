Life’s messy.

_Learning_ is messy.

And progress, in the midst of it, seldom seems like it.

Looking back personally, the most valuable lessons have always come from chaotic periods. When it seems like you’re not progressing. Maybe even regressing.

On the flip side, periods of success, when you get to reap the rewards from your previous hard work, seldom change you for the better.

But having internalized this, you can start to remind yourself in those darker moments that it’s now that you grow.

Or when you’re studying, you can make peace with the feeling of confusion. Realizing that’s the hotbed for aha-moments.

Understanding must arise out of confusion.

Order only out of chaos.

That’s my experience at least.

But it’s still hard to believe when you’re in the midst of it, of course.

A part of me still doubts it everytime: _“this can’t possibly turn out good”_.

And yet, things have their way of sorting themselves out if you let them.

Philosophy is way too important only to be reserved for academics. Sadly however, that's exactly what has happened.

> ...this kind of wisdom has been taken from us, co-opted and deliberately obscured by selfish, sheltered academics. They deprived us of philosophy's true use: as an operating system for the difficulties and hardships of life.

> <cite>Ryan Holiday, on philosophy's true use in The Obstacle Is the Way (p. 184)</cite>

It has come to be something esoteric. Academia has put more emphasis on analytic rigor at the cost of real world practicality. And philosophy's original use, of learning how to live, is long forgotten by the masses.

**It's not that the modern scholar version of philosophy is inherently bad but that it has come at the cost of something equally important.**

Consequently, the shallow self-help genre has had to take the place of where philosophy once stood. Holiday continues:

> Philosophy was never what happened in the classroom, it was a set of lessons from the battlefield of life.

True philosophers are not academics, isolated from mainstream society up in the ivory tower. They're doers. Ordinary people striving for a higher purpose whilst battling the everyday hardships of life.

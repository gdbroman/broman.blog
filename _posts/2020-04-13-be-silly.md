Why have fun?

Because it's fun! Obviously.

To be silly is to be human.

And yet, we like to think of modern man as someone very serious.

Because that's what it means to be an adult, isn't it?

To frown and tell kids to "stop being so silly" and "get your act together!"

We have come to think of being serious as something good and silliness as something bad. That seriousness is what holds our civilization together.

**But here's a thought: maybe you can be silly and get things done.**

One could even argue that it is silliness that has gotten us to where society is today.

Every innovator, entrepreneur, artist, writer, thinker and revolutionary have been deeply silly people.

Because, to be creative you have to cultivate your inner child. That part of you that has not got it's curiosity beaten out of it by society.

Besides, being serious is just boring!

And we could all need some more fun in our lives.

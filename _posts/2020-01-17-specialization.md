title: "Is Specialization Only for Insects?"

In the science fiction novel _Time Enough for Love_, Robert Heinlein, through the fictional character Lazarus, gives the following description of a competent man:

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

But one of the main principles in economics is that specialization is beneficial both for the individual and the society as a whole. By narrowing your craft you can gain a comparative advantage and trade your abilities for a higher price.

So which way is it? Given that you want to maximize your fulfilment and financial benefit as an individual - should you try to narrow your skills or become a jack of all trades?

## Leonardo da Vinci and The Specialization Theory
The specialization theory was first developed by Adam smith in The Wealth of Nations, 1776. It states that total power output and therefore economic growth is increased when labor is distributed between individuals. 

Economic actors that specialize in a skill simply become better at it; making the whole process more efficient. But what about genius polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci who have the ability to master multiple skills?

Well, first of all, statistically speaking you should assume that you're not like Leonardo da Vinci. But even if you were da Vinci and had what economists call an absolute advantage (which you indeed may have), it's still preferable to outsource your skills to others. Why? Two things: opportunity cost and something called comparative advantage.

This is because even polymaths are better at some things than others and if you want to maximize your productivity you should focus on your very best skill. Think about it: let's say you're a really good civil engineer and a painter. Let's say at your engineering job you have a salary of 80k but as a painter you can cash in over 200k.

So in other words, you're - financially speaking - a better painter than engineer - even though you're better than average at both. So if you want to maximize income you should spend more time painting than building bridges. At your engineering job the opportunity cost is 200k so it's simply not worth it.

The conclusion thus becomes: if you seek to maximize income you should gain a comparative advantage by specializing.

## Intersect!
Note, however that specialization doesn't necessarily mean more narrow. In fact, many of the most lucrative comparative advantages are intersections of multiple domains and skills, not a funnel of one skill.

This is good news! It means that you don't have to become a brain surgeon or ant eater researcher for the rest of your life. By intersecting the areas you're interested in and good at you can gain a unique comparative advantage. This is what Scott Adams eloquently likes to call building an edge by developing a unique talent stack.

Let's illustrate this with Scott himself as an example. With all due respect, Scott is not the best comedian — he's good but he ain't no Bill Burr or Seinfeld. He’s also not much of a business man either - though he's better than average. And lastly, he has never taken any writing classes - but again: he's better than average. On this he comments:

> When you add in my ordinary business skills, my strong work ethic, my risk tolerance, and my reasonably good sense of humor, I’m fairly unique. And in this case that uniqueness has commercial value.

## Conclusion - Was Adam Smith Wrong?
That Adam Smith guy was on to something. Though to simply advice a person, at the begging of his or her career, to specialize at all cost would not be entirely optimal in my opinion.

Times have changed. Because of technology, monetizing your talent stack has become easier. Brute force specialization, in the form of a concert level piano player or a world class engineer, is no longer the only option. And quite frankly it's neither the most lucrative one.

Instead you should focus on developing your unique talent stack. Think if you can intersect some of your best skills and then create something valuable.

Maybe you still choose to call this act of intersection as specialization and thus save Adam Smith from being wrong. However, as far as I'm concerned, the label doesn't matter. What matters is action.

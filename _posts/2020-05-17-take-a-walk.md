People seldom take walks anymore.

With Ubers, subways and electric scooters, there’s simply no need.

Or when we do walk, it’s always to get somewhere.

But walking for its own sake is becoming increasingly rare.

That’s sad.

Strolling is such a luxury.

It calms your mind and makes you more present.

The hardest part is just convincing yourself of its effectiveness.

_“What are you, some kind of grandpa? Walking without a final destination is stupid and a waste of time. Stay at home and work instead!”_

But it’s not stupid.

**I’ve never taken a walk and _not_ felt better afterwards.**

Stuck on a math problem? Take a walk.

Feel mentally drained? Take a walk.

About to make an important life decision? Take. A. Walk.

And as you become an experienced walker, you’ll start to realize how often you’re lost in thought. You’ll walk down the road you take every morning and all of a sudden notice stuff you’ve never even seen before.

Like how beautiful everything is. The houses. The trees. THE SKY. OMG THERE’S A SKY. You’ve just been too blind to see it.

You could call it a form of meditation.

But what's nice about walking is that it's far more accessible for the average westerner.

To sit cross legged on the floor for 20 minutes is boring. To step out of your house is not as boring.

When in doubt, take a walk.

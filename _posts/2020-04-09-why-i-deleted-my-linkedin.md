I just deleted my LinkedIn.

And all the 1000 or so followers and contacts with it.

**Did I just commit career suicide?**

Maybe.

But I don't think so.

## I Thought LinkedIn Was Different. Boy, Was I Wrong.

It all started with Facebook.

Instagram was my second victim.

Then Snapchat.

But LinkedIn always survived my digital minimalism-purges, since I've been able to rationalize its utility.

That it was beneficial for networking.

For your career.

But at last, LinkedIn too had to kick the bucket.

This seems like a foolish thing to do. Especially if you're ambitious and career oriented.

And fair enough. It might.

But here's some reasoning for why you might consider doing it.

## Wu Wei - Movement vs Progress

Fanatically emailing people is movement.

Learning is progress.

Gaining followers on social media is movement.

Creating is progress.

Nature does not hurry, yet accomplishes everything

Lao Tzu
It's more than easy to move. Everybody moves.

But most movement does not translate into progress.

Wu Wei is a term from Confucianism, which means non-doing in Chinese. It's about doing less while accomplishing more.

And for me, I realized that if I took the time and energy LinkedIn sucked out of my day into things that mattered more, like reading and writing, I would actually be happier and more productive.

Ha! Who would've thought? Social media harming your happiness and productivity!?

## Don't Be Boring

If you want to have a good career, you'll have to master the art of story telling. Specifically, telling your story.

This is how you differentiate yourself.

It's just like as if you were a product.

So tell me. Why should anyone buy you?

Sounds a bit bizarre. I agree.

But it's how the modern economy works. The good news is, it doesn't have to be worse than it already is.

Look at it this way: all social platforms and personal websites are ways of telling your story.

And LinkedIn happens to be the worst one. Or at least, most superficial, and that's a problem since vulnerability is crucial for good story telling.

LinkedIn just lists your degrees, skills and previous positions.

The problem is: **you're not your degrees, skills and previous positions.**

As cheesy as it sounds: you're much more than that!

And that's actually a very practical claim.

You can tell such a more interesting story than merely just listing your accomplishments like your computer's freaking technical details.

However, LinkedIn trains your brain to view others and yourself as nothing more than a handful of bullet points.

It shaped my thinking to "will this look good on my LinkedIn resume?" instead of "will this be fulfilling?"

And I did not like that it did that to me.

Not one bit.

## Network Is Everything! Yeah, But

How many times have you heard that networking is essential when it comes to landing a job?

But networking doesn't work. At least not in the traditional sense.

Because what are you doing? Just exchanging emails and business cards over flat conversations at events you couldn't care less about.

Or worse, becoming one in the crowd of LinkedIn direct messages. This is not how you build meaningful relationships.

"But networking isn't about meaningful relationships!" you might object. Yeah, maybe not. But even if you're just seeking a job referral, that will still not take you all the way.

My two cents is this: handcrafting an incredibly well researched email, letter or knocking on the company's CEO's door is way more effective (in reversed order).

It's faster than running around gathering business cards. And with that time you can instead focus more on improving your skills that actually make you valuable.

A few meaningful connections beats multiple weak ones. A few meaningful connections and a unique talent stack makes you unstoppable.

## Going Forward...Being Yourself?

We talked about how telling a unique story is your best bet at making it big in today's economy.

But more important than that, writing your own story is what will make your life meaningful.

In other words, not being different for it's own sake, but for your own sake.

And sometimes that'll mean great sacrifices. Like moving from your home town despite your friends and family hating you for it.

Other times it'll be something as trivial as deleting your LinkedIn account.

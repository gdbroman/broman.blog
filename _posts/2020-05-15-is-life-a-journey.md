What are the best movies?

Where the protagonist sets out on a hero’s journey.

Like in Interstellar when Cooper leaves earth and travels into deep space.

Or when Batman tries to escape prison and save Gotham.

But life is seldom like that.

Most of the time, we’re just going through the motions in some kind of system.

School. College. Work.

A determined, unadventurous path.

Not much of a journey, eh?

But should it be?

I can’t see why not. Adventure is undeniably more exciting than a set path.

And ever since this dawned on me, I’ve forced myself to say yes more.

Even when I don't feel like it.

And it’s uncomfortable.

It sucks.

My average pulse is like 10 beats higher nowadays.

But at least my soul is alive.

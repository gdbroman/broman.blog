So much of our frustrations in life stem from one singular belief.

The belief that people can change.

That people can change, and maybe we can help them to do so.

We naively think that if we just give our friends and family enough feedback, over a long enough period of time, we can train them to behave as we like.

We therefore bark when they forget to do the dishes or frown when they bore us.

All with the hope that they could be more like us.

The problem is: they're not.

They're simply not, and they never will be.

Because let's be honest here. How many people do you know of that, at some point in their life, dramatically changed their behaviour or personality?

Of how many wives do you know, that after years of complaining, finally got their husband to do the dishes right?

Right. Not so many.

Most people never change.

And on some level, we all already know this. Yet, we constantly hide from the fact because it seems so depressing. We'd much rather live in a naive land of opportunity where everything's possible and there's no such thing as a lost cause.

But that's a shame. Because, whilst well-intentioned, this naivete gives rise to so much unnecessary misery in our lives. Whereas a more fatalistic attitude can actually aid our happiness.

**When you accept that you can't change other people's behavior, their lack of it finally stops affecting you.**

When you finally accept that others will never be like you, you'll stop to be annoyed when they are simply not.

We are all different and that's okay. No need to get upset. Because it ultimately won't help.

Instead, let's try to focus on what we can control: Our own behavior.

To lead by example.

This is the best we can do.

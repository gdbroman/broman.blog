Things are complicated, man.

And a good cause is seldom enough.

Running a profitable business is not just solving a problem.

Free thinking is not an automatic outcome of institutionalized education.

And eliminating poverty is not as easy as just giving money away.

Effective altruists are concerned with doing as much good as possible.

These are often portrayed as egoless, hyper-rational people who take high paying jobs only to donate most of their salary to those in need.

Its premise is hard to argue with.

Why wouldn’t you want to do as much good as possible?

But some part of me isn’t convinced that it’s a practical aim.

Because how do you know what set of actions maximizes utility?

When you can’t measure it?

When the human brain can’t calculate the state of the universe even a day in advance?

It might seem like I’m being a relativistic a**hole. I can already hear the objections: “You’re saying that I shouldn’t donate money to starving kids!?”

No. That’s most likely a good thing. My problem is just when you claim to sit on the key to the universe, saying that so and so is objectively the best way to conduct your life.

There are many ways to do good. Even more ways of screwing up. And to claim that you know the one that’s the best?

Please.

Lastly, for many, effective altruism would probably be another variant of the oxygen mask-problem.

Many (dare I say most?) can’t even take good care of themselves.

And when the plane’s crashing, you won’t be able to help many others with their oxygen masks - if you don’t already have one yourself.

Clean your room, bucko.

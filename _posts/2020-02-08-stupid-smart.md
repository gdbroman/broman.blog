_"I always feel stupid"._ Now, who would say such a thing? Some kind of dummy? No! That's nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman. Now, what does that tell you?

My take is this: If you're not feeling stupid on a regular basis one of the following things are happening:

You're not challening yourself enough, or
You're not surrounding yourself with smart enough people
Never be too comfortable. Never be the smartest person in the room. Otherwise you'll stagnate - nay, regress - as a human.

## Embarrassment

Are you embarrassed of your younger self? Oh yeah? Good! Looking back at yourself five years ago and thinking "Boy, was I stupid back then" is a good sign. It means that you're improving. But if you think you're just the same as five years back, then something's wrong.

The smartest and most knowledgeable person will be the fastest to admit his incompetence (that's the Dunning-Kruger effect for you). Likewise, the older you get and the more you learn about life, the more you realize how little everyone - including yourself - truly know.

Keep improving.

Continue feeling stupid.

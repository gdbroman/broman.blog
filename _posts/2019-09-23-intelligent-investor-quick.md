Most investors who fail do so because they focus too much on what the market is doing _right now._

An investor is not interested in being temporarily right. In order to achieve one’s long term financial goals, one has to be right over a _long period of time._ 

To achieve adequate results - in other words, **to follow the index, is easier than most people think but to beat the market however is a lot harder than it looks.**

One would think that to do a little better than average, one would just have to spend a little more time than the average person researching stocks - but this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Warren Buffett has said that during his whole lifetime he’s only been able to identify ten people(!) who have consistently been able to beat the market. 

So it is _possible_ to to consistently beat the market. With discipline and resilience you _could_ it. But probably not.

But if you do want to give beating Mr. Market a try you will have to exploit that he's seldom right. **The stock market is merely a reflection of people's expectations.** It may correlate with the companies' real value, but _they're not the same thing._

The idea is unsurprisingly to buy a stock when the company is undervalued by the market. This should be done mechanically following a checklist.

And that checklist includes having a **margin of safety.** The intelligent investor should only buy a stock when its price is lower than ⅔ of the company's estimated underlying value.

Also, realizing that the company's value is not always reflected in the stock price, you should be comfortable with not always knowing the stock’s daily price.

Only a gambler is manic about the daily price and bets on the stock’s short term trajectory. Be an investor - not a gambler.

And if you want to be a passive investor - not spending much time thinking about investing but still having your money work for you - the best way is undeniably to buy index funds with low fees.

Lastly, focus on what you _can_ control. You can’t control if any given stock will go up or down but you can control fees, expectations, risk, taxes and most importantly your behavior.

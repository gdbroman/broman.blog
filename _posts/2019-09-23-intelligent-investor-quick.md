This is a really quick summary of The Intelligent Investor. Note: because of it’s shortness some points have been extremely simplified and interpreted. Let us begin.

Most investors who fail do so because they focus too much on what the market is doing right now.

An investor is not interested in being temporarily right. In order to achieve one’s long term financial goals, one has to be right over a long period of time. 

To achieve adequate results - in other words, **to follow the index, is easier than most people think but to beat the market however is a lot harder than it looks.**

One would think that to do a little better than average, one would just have to spend a little more time than the average person researching stocks - but this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Warren Buffett has said that during his whole lifetime he’s only been able to identify ten people who have consistently been able to beat the market. 

So it is possible to to consistently beat the market. With discipline and resilience you _could_ it. But probably not.

But if you do want to give beating the market a try you will have to exploit that Mr. Market - Grahams nickname for the market - seldom is right. The idea is to buy a stock when a company is undervalued by the market. This should be done mechanically following a checklist.

That checklist includes having a margin of safety. The intelligent investor should only buy a stock when its price is lower than ⅔ of its estimated value.

Also, an investor estimates a stock’s value based on the underlying company and realizes that it’s not always reflected in the stock price. Thus, you should be comfortable with not always knowing the stock’s daily price.

Only a gambler is manic about the daily price and bets on the stock’s short term trajectory. Be an investor - not a gambler.

If you’re going to be a passive investor, the best way is to buy index funds with low fees to diversify your assets and save time. Because it’s near impossible to find winners it’s safest to just follow the index.

Focus on what you _can_ control. You can’t control if any given stock will go up or down but you can control fees, expectations, risk, taxes and most importantly your behavior.

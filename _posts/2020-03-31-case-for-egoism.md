On airplanes, the flight safety video always instructs you to put on your own oxygen mask first, before helping others.

Why?

**Because if you run out of oxygen, you can't help anyone.**

The same goes for rescuing someone who's drowning. Then you should put your foot out in front of you to separate yourself from the person, and not proceed until he or she has calmed down.

Why?

Because if the person is panicking, they'll try to cling onto you.

But what if the person doesn't calm down and drowns? you might object.

Yeah, well. What if you _both_ drown?

## Egoism is Altruistic and Altruism Egotistical
The world is complicated. It is actually very difficult to make things better.

Even if one's intentions are good, it is not uncommon, when trying to solve a problem, to actually end up making it worse! This is fairly easy to spot in public policy-making.

A flawed character is more likely to worsen things than make them better. It might thus be reasonable to focus on improving oneself - one's own character and skills - before trying to fix something in the outside world.

## Egoism is Necessary for Self Improvement
We all know of people who care more about other's then they do about themselves. These are very unfortunate people. Their intentions are nothing but good - and yet, they often end up living very troubled lives.

You have to be somewhat selfish if you want to improve yourself since it requires will and time. So you can't be working on other's problem's all of the time. You need boundaries.

Paradoxically, the one's who set clear boundaries, might ultimately end up doing more good from a utilitarian perspective, since when they do help others, they're much more effective.

## If it Does not Help you, Forget it
Only consume knowledge that helps you live and die better.

Cut off friends who do not want the best for you.

Do not eat food that drains your energy.

This is what it means to have boundaries.

It might seem harsh. But it's the price you pay for being a useful human being.

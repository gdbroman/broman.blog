You wake up freezing.

The savannah is lit up by blue moonlight.

There’s no food and you have to get going before the sun rises.

You grab your sharpened stone and set off into the night.

Into the unknown.

Not knowing when will be your next meal. Nor if you’ll encounter a lion or hostile tribe.

But you accept and embrace the uncertainty. And in it you find calm.

Because you’re on a journey.

And in the chaos, stillness has arrived.

This sort of heightened sense of purpose and awareness was our default setting as hunters and gatherers.

But ever since we settled and became civilized, it has become a rare state of consciousness.

Civilization has made us numb.

We never encounter death anymore. When someone dies, they’re quickly shoved off to hospitals. In movies, death is portrayed as unreal. Something that could never occur to ourselves.

We never need to go hungry anymore. Delicious food can always be directly delivered to you by the click of a button.

We never need to be cold anymore. All rooms are nicely tempered. We have warm comfortable clothes. Even the water is heated.

We never need to be bored anymore. You can’t even take a shit without having a firehose of information pointed at your head.

The art of living an adventurous life has been lost.

> A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to meet a House-dog who was passing by.
> 
> "Ah, Cousin," said the Dog. "I knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you. Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly given to you?"
> 
> "I would have no objection," said the Wolf, "if I could only get a place."
> 
> "I will easily arrange that for you," said the Dog; "come with me to my master and you shall share my work."
> 
> So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together. On the way there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the Dog's neck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about.
> 
> "Oh, it is nothing," said the Dog. "That is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it."
> 
> "Is that all?" said the Wolf. "Then good-bye to you, Master Dog."

We’ve gone from being warriors to workers.

From wolves to dogs.

So what’s the solution?

Because society and technology is making everything easier we now need artificial hardships. To voluntarily make ourselves uncomfortable.

Maybe one can try to run marathons. Contemplate death. Fast. Take cold showers. And delete social media.

Because it’s better to starve free than be a fat slave.

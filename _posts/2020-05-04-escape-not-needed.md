Is there ever a place for shallow activity? For playing video games or going out drinking?

The common answer would be yes - that you do it to “relax”. To unwind and forget about your problems for a second. To escape.

But here’s a question we can all ask ourselves in those moments: Would I still want to escape if I lived the life I truly wanted?

Sure, maybe one can argue that for some, their ideal life involves both sides. To work hard and play hard. Yin and yang.

My problem is this: In life, there are no breaks. There’ll never be a day where you’ll go: “that’s it, no more problems from here on!”

Life is an ever-growing series of problems. So to turn away from them is not a long term strategy. If you feel stressed, seek solutions, not distractions.

But then another objection would be that escapism is fun. That it gives life a bit more flavor. And that maybe it isn’t wasted time after all if you have fun while doing it?

Dios mío, man.

See, that’s the problem. You’re using happiness as a metric. The thing is; life is suffering. So good luck with that. I’ll stick to maximizing meaning.

Because it is possible to appreciate both the good and the bad in life. Not only intellectually understand the utility of hardships - no, to actually view them as beautiful.

To feel alive instead of beat down when you are in the midst of hell. And when this is so, there won’t be a need for escape.

How? Well, when was the last time you ever just sat through boredom or ran a 5k without music - alone, with your own thoughts? Maybe start there, then.

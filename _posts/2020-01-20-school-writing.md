title: "What School Taught you About Writing is Wrong"

In school, teachers tell us that there's a difference between writing and talking. And indeed it naturally is. You talk sloppy and write eloquently. And school teachers encourage us to differentiate our communication in this way. But if you want others to read your stuff - that's horrible advice!

Writing as you speak doesn't mean being stupid. As Paul Graham points out in one of his [essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html); dumb ideas can be written eloquently and complex ideas can be explained easily. Don't mistake content for structure. Just write what you're thinking as you would say it to a friend.

## Why do we read?
Think about it. Why do you pick up a book? In order to be impressed by the author's sophisticated vocabulary or complicated sentence structures? No! That's almost never the case - with the possible exception of poems. (If you are a poet - what I'm saying here doesn't apply to you.)

> Every sentence has a purpose. It doesn’t exist to take up space, it exists to change the reader, to move her from here to there.
> 
> This sentence, then, what’s it for?
> 
> If it doesn’t move us closer to where we seek to go, delete it.

We read books because of their ideas. The author's job thus becomes to communicate ideas. So of course, communication style matters. It's actually very important.

And that's why I'm writing this. I'm not saying you shouldn't try to pick the right words or sentence structure. In fact, that's exactly what I'm saying. The point is: you should try to make the ideas as easily understandable as possible. And in most cases that simply means writing as you speak.

## Why talking sucks
Stephen King confessed in an interview from 1993 that he's a much better writer than orator. And to my own estimation this seems to generally be the case for good writers. It's not that writers are bad speakers - they're probably still above average. But in comparison to their writing, it's gibberish.

Writing allows you to think through your ideas and how to articulate them in a way that's just not possible in conversation. When conversing you have to be quick on your feet, take social behavior into consideration and the opportunity cost is thoughtful ideas. David Foster Wallace seems to agree. Here's him commenting on books as a medium in a Charlie Rose interview:

> I think part of the fun for me [reading books] was being a part of some kind of exchange between consciousnesses - a way for human beings to talk to each other about stuff we normally can't talk about

## So what makes good writing?
Conclusively you can describe writing as a platonic idealization of talking. It's what talking should have been all along. I would therefore like to propose that good writing is combining the thoughtfulness that writing allows with the structural simplicity of talking.

Most people get the first part about thoughtfulness right but completely forget about the second part of simplicity. That's what school taught you wrong.

Write as you speak.

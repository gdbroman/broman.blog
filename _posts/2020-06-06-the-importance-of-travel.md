Maybe you seek to become more compassionate.

To take better care of yourself.

Or, to find a greater purpose?

We’re all on our own unique journey.

Though some are more conscious of it than others.

And if you’ve ever left home for an extended period of time, you know that an external journey can aid the internal one.

How - upon returning - you view everything with a fresh pair of eyes.

Noticing new opportunities, and how previous seemingly insurmountable problems are no longer.

You know what to do and how.

Everything’s clear and your mind more open.

Stay in the same place for too long and you get stuck in a rut.

Some of this wisdom lives on in our modern culture - but on a very low level.

We know that we’re supposed to travel - but why?

Do we know?

Not really.

It’s relaxing - or something like that.

To be totally honest, we mostly do it because everyone else does.

Once a year we partake in the standard routine of lying down on a beach at a fancy hotel. And why complain? It’s pleasurable!

Well, these kinds of vacations seldom leave a mark on us.

They tend to melt together into one foggy pot of sandy feet and margaritas.

Once again, we’re reminded that pleasure is not a satisfactory goal.

Travel can be so much more than that.

A challenging hike through the mountains might make you realize how beautifully meaningful life is.

A month of sailing alone could bring you closer to your friends and family.

And a solo retreat into the woods might make you religious.

Travel and you shall progress.

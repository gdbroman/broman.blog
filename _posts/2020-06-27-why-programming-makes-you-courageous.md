It’s not the logic.

And it’s not the math.

It’s about learning how to live in confusion.

Being okay with not knowing why something doesn’t work.

And then not knowing why it does work.

Creating complex applications has much in common with the human condition.

There are all of these parts interacting with each other. And maybe you can understand their function on a higher level. But whenever there’s a bug, it shatters your confidence and makes you fundamentally question your understanding.

Like in life, whenever there’s tragedy, it makes you question what it’s all about.

**But the bird is not courageous.**

See, it’s not courage to tread the harder path if you’re unaware of the risk.

That’s just naivete.

No, courage is knowing very well the implied risks, being afraid, and then doing it anyway.

When you’re in a rot, wondering what it all means but then continuing, despite the chaos, with the faith that eventually, order will arise.

That's what programming, writing, painting and all other creative pursuits have in common.

The requirement for courage.

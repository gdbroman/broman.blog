This is a summary of Ray Dalio’s educational video _How the Economic Machine Works_. It’s worth a watch. But if you don’t have 30 minutes — you can read this quick summary.

Note: this is a simplified summary of an already simplified model. Take it with a grain of salt. Enjoy!

What’s the economic machine and how does it work? Few know and those who do, seldom agree with each other. Ray Dalio is the founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates which manages over $160 billion. Here’s what he thinks.

## The constituents
The economy is built by a few simple pieces and many transactions. The transactions are driven by human nature and create three fundamental forces which drive the economy:

1. Productivity growth
2. The short term debt cycle
3. The long term debt cycle

These three forces make a sufficiently good model for how the market works and what it‘s currently doing.

## Transactions
You have to give some to get some and how much you get depends on how much you give. When a buyer gives a seller money or credit in exchange for a product, service or financial asset, we call it a transaction. All the transactions over the same thing (e.g. cars or bonds) is called a market.

## Credit
Dalio claims that credit is the most important part of the economy as well as the most misunderstood.

When a borrower promises to pay back and the lender believes it, credit along with debt is simultaneously created.

When individuals increase their income, generally, they also increase borrowing since they’re granted more by the banks. This in turn increases spending. (Note that this is an observation— not an invitation. What’s best individually in this case is obviously the opposite.)

And because one person’s spending is another one’s income; this leads to economic growth and is why we have cycles.

## Cycles
When we learn new things this as a civilization, living standards are raised. We call this growth.

Growth depends on two factors:

Innovation and productivity increase growth in the long term.
Credit determines growth in the short term.
When economic activity increases we call it a boom. And when it increases faster than the production of products and services, the prices go along with it and we have inflation (when demand increase faster than supply).

In times of less spending, the prices drop and we call this deflation. Economic activity decrease and we get a recession.

## Short Term Credit Cycles and The Central Bank
Some inflation is good but the central bank doesn’t want too much of it (nor deflation) since it creates problems. In order to control this they adjust the interest rates for loans.

If economic activity decreases, the central bank decrease interest rates in order to increase spending and vice versa. And on it goes back and forth between raising and lowering interest rates.

The result? Short term credit cycles that last 5–8 years.

Note that every short term credit cycle ends up with higher debt than it started with. This is because people tend to loan more than they pay off. The result is a long term debt cycle.

## Long Term Credit Cycles and Bubbles
Despite increasing debt, lender’s accept even more loans. This is because on the surface, everything seems great. Financial assets are increasing in value and the stock market’s booming. Buying assets with loaned money is profitable. We call this scenario a bubble.

This can’t continue forever however. At some point, incomes are gonna have to stop increasing and people are gonna have to decrease spending. Once again, because one person’s spending is another one’s income, economic activity as a whole and people’s credit scores starts declining.

This point, before everyone start’s paying back their loans, is called a deleveraging. And right after, when everyone’s trying to sell their assets and the stock market crashes we get a depression (e.g. 2008).

The problem with a depression is that the central bank can’t fix it with lowering interest rates like in a regular recession — interest rates are already too low. The economy is just gonna have to ride it out whilst the government does at least one out of four things:

1. Decrease spending
2. Eliminate debt
3. Distribute wealth amongst individuals
4. Print new money

Dalio states that a deleveraging can be “beautiful” if you balance 3. and 4. just right.

## Dalio’s Three Rules of Thumb for Individuals and Policy Makers
Lastly, Dalio, encourages you to do the following:

Don’t let debt increase faster than income
Don’t let income increase faster than productivity
Do everything you can to increase productivity

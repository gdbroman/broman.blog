The moment we start building a persona around our previous successes is the moment we start relaxing: when we stop watching our step, trip and fall.

An age characterized by branding and internet presence is a very dangerous such. Because whilst full of opportunities, there's also a fatal risk.

The trap of getting enough positive feedback from your marketed persona that you stop improving on your abilities that got you there in the first place.

This might present itself as harsh. But it seems that's just the nature of reality. In life, there are no breaks. It's always going. Never a time for kicking back.

And there are only two directions. Either you are heading up or pointing down - no in between. Things deteriorate with time. That's entropy. You've never seen a house not taken care of get better after three years.

The only way to improve is through humility. Don't say "I know how that works". Ask "how does it work?" Never think you're somehow better or wiser than others. Ask what they might know that you don't.

Now you're pointing up.

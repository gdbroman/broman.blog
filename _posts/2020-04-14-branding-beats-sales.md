I think most people would agree that a personal trainer should provide their clients with the tools that make them obsolete as teachers.

Teach a man to fish-kind of thing.

Analogously, when you're building a product, digital or otherwise, strive to put yourself out of business.

It sounds insane. But let's provide some context.

## The customer doesn't want to feel like they're your prisoner.
Google, for example, does not actually want you spending time on their landing page. Or even on the search results. The less you notice them - the more seamless the experience - the more successful they are. Since their business is getting you from A to B.

"But I'm not Google", you might say. No - exactly! So you need to think about this even more! People are especially not going to think about your business when you're small.

## Naturally, no one will care about your business. People just want their problem solved.
The last thing you want to come across as, is being needy.

So don't be needy.

Give. And don't expect a dime in return.

Paradoxically, that mentality will get people promoting your business for you. Voluntarily. Not because you forced it down people's throat.

## Put a cat in your lap and it immediatly jumps down
Let it voluntarily jump up and the cat will repeatedly return no matter how many times you push it down.

This is why branding beats sales.

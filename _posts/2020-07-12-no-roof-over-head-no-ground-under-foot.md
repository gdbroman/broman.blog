It's perhaps one of life’s most valuable skills: The ability to be comfortable with uncertainty.

Being comfortable not knowing what’s gonna happen and not having all the answers.

That feeling of: the world doesn’t have to make sense.

To be able to go through periods of feeling naked and unsure.

In zen they call it having “no roof over head, no ground under foot”.

Because the prerequisite for clarity is confusion. The greatest insights must come from equally great ignorance.

But you gotta be willing to discard your own beliefs.

Freedom is not free and the price for comfort is discomfort.

It’s the ultimate marshmallow test:

Either be safe now and face uncertainty later. Or, embrace uncertainty for a more promising future.

Either way, uncertainty is coming for all of us.

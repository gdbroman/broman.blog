In my previous post [Six Arguments Against College](/the-case-against-college), I claimed that college tends to get overly romanticized. But on social media, college is increasingly getting a bad rap, especially in the entrepreneurial world with startup founders telling you to DROP OUT RIGHT NOW.

So I'd like to cut back the slack on graduates by presenting the other side of the coin. Here's a list of arguments for why you _should_ go to college.

## 1. It Gives You Perspective: Hold on - You’re Saying I’m Not a Super Genius!?

Going to college can be a humbling experience - and for some, even devastating. All of a sudden you realize that there's all these people who are just as smart, or even smarter than you. You've gone from being the bright kid in high school to nothing more than average. You recognize that the big ego you've built up because of your - hitherto considered smartness - was nothing but a big fish in a small pond-situation.

The realization that you're not as smart as you thought you were, though initially painful, is certainly healthy. It makes you more humble and aware of your capabilities. This is really valuable. You can never be too aware. As Socrates once said: "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing".

Of course, there is a risk that this can go too far. You don't want to underestimate your capabilities. Unfortunately this is fairly common and it was mentioned in my case against college. 

### A Note Peer Pressure

As Malcom Gladwell pointed out in a talk, feeling inadequate is probably the number one reason why students drop out. No matter where you look, all the colleges consistently show the same trend: the bottom third of the class (ranked by SAT score) has the lowest chance of graduation.

You might think this is fairly obvious but then you've missed the point - this trend persists NO MATTER THE COLLEGE. This means that the bottom third of the class at MIT or Harvard is just as unlikely to graduate as the bottom third at a random low tier community college - even though the bottom third at an Ivy League still has way higher SAT scores than the top third at the low tier college. 

Constantly being around smart people can give you a sense that you're dumber than you really are. The conclusion thus becomes: if you want to increase your chance of graduating - don't go to a prestigious school.

## 2. Networking

Contacts are important. Want to get sought after positions and advance your career? You'll need referrals. Want to start a startup? You'll need a co-founder.

While you can definitely acquire contacts outside of college, I would argue that it's harder - at least if you're low on extroversion. That's because in college you're already around people with some similar interests. It can frankly become easier to relate to others.

## 3. Formal Education Forces Esoteric Knowledge

Some dislike formal education because of its bureaucratic, cumulative and myopic nature. Every chunk of knowledge should be built on top of the previous one and no parallells between topics allowed!

And I get it - I feel like that myself sometimes. But there are also positives to the industrialized nature of public schooling. And that is: you'll learn about topics you'd otherwise never come in contact with. Some might choose to call this "learning useless stuff with zero relevance to real life". But you can also phrase it as becoming well-read. And this is not necessarily knowing for knowings sake. Sometimes the most esoteric and initially useless idea later turns out to actually have utility or give you a powerful insight in a seemingly unrelated topic.

That being said; you should still self-educate. In formal education you're forced to read up on a wide variety of topics you wouldn't otherwise do. But when you self-educate you get to indulge exclusively in your smaller set of favorite topics. This is the time when you hone your craft and actually develop your expertise. College is simply a stepping stone - not a means to an end. Mark Twain didn't even like to categorize college as education because of this:

> Some people get an education without going to college. The rest get it after they get out.

## Conclusion

If you're located in the US or some other country with sky high tuition fees, my suggestion would be to attend a cheaper community college of sorts. That way you actually increase your chance of graduation and don't end up drowning in student loans.

Isn't it wonderful how we can take people through a curriculum where they read lots, for multiple years, and at the end of everything - it will all have stuck? Like pouring water into a bowl.

Yeah, well I don't know about you, but my brain's not a bowl.

If I don't see immediate use for something, my eyes glaze over.

And even if I _do_ see a possible use case, I'll have to apply the information in order for it to stick. Otherwise it'll be gone the day after the examination.

And I'm not alone in this, considering how many people hate school and learning in general (and how clueless most college grads are).

It can thus be helpful to separate information that you aspire to learn into two buckets, based on this difference in relevance.

Information which you can't see a use case for now - but maybe in the future - is called _just in case-information_. Whereas information you actually _need_ is called just in time-ditto.

The latter tends to stick whereas the former is forgotten. Unfortunately, college is mostly packed with the former.

Which probably explains why someone can plow through a four year degree and still wonder _"what did I just learn?"_

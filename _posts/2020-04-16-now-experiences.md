How come that near death experiences, almost always, also turn into near life experiences?

That we feel the most alive when we look death in the eye?

And it doesn't even have to be actual death - or even our own.

Simply contemplating the finality of life, Ã  la the stoics, can bring you into presence like nothing else.

Or - when we shock our nervous system by doing a cold plunge into an ice bath.

Or when we experience flow, practicing our craft.

What these things have in common is that they narrow our time perspective.

When you jump into an ice cold lake, there is no worrying about tomorrow, or embarrassment from yesterday. No there's just you and that cold fucking water.

Presence opens up your mind. Time travel closes it.

And being present is really what we mean when we say that we "feel alive" - isn't it?

So maybe, if we seek to fall in love with life, we should make the present moment our best friend.

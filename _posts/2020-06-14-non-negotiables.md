What are your non-negotiables?

Things you do every single day, no matter what.

In the morning, before everyone else’s goals and calendars get a grip on you.

Mine's reading, writing and exercise. Preferably in that order:

1. Reading to secure a steady flow of new ideas
2. Writing to sort out those ideas
3. Exercise to callous the mind

Non-negotiables are things that - no matter how badly the rest of the day turns out - will keep you on the path.

Such as meditation, journaling and not checking email after 9pm.

What all good daily habits have in common is that they’re not miracles.

They are easy to do - but also easy NOT to do.

Precisely because of how insignificant they might seem.

Maybe they only improve you by 0.1% each time.

But over time that compounds.

Keeping you in that steady upwards spiral.

No one cares. Don't worry about it.

There. Someone more important than me said it. Are we done here?

What's that?...You still don't buy it?

Well, I can't prove it. So, for the sake of argument, let's say people do care.

Still. What does it matter? It's your life.

## you should really consider stop being afraid of heights

Some give the advice to "stop taking yourself so seriously". But I think that's completely backwards.

It's also extremely impractical. It's like saying to "stop being afraid of heights!" Yeah, thanks Einstein.

But it's backwards because when you let the fear of judgment disallow you from the life you seek, I'd argue you are not taking life seriously enough!

Not fully realizing it's preciousness.

You have a life! That shit's rare man.

And don't tell me you're somehow "above" putting yourself out there.

First of all; you self-important piece of s#!%.

You really need to stop taking yourself so seriously.

And second, if these people have a blog...

*Bill Gates
* Arianna Huffington
* Richard Branson
* Mark Cuban
...and don't complain about being "too good" for personal blogging, so can you.

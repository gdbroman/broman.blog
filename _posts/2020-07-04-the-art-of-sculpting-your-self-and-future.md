Is it naive to believe that one is in full control of one's own future?

What’s the difference between courage and naivete?

Awareness: **The naive person is not aware of his foolishness whereas the courageous person is** (but nonetheless does not let that bog him down).

The notion that one is completely free to sculpt one’s own self and future is a matter of reinforcing belief.

You either believe it or you don’t. You either choose the upwards spiral, or the downwards spiral.

Those who deny their own agency, act without conviction and thus never get to see evidence for it.

Whereas those who believe in their ability to change their world, most often do.

You call that naive?

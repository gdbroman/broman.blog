Do you want to go through life struggling or at ease?

Suffering or flowing?

Thomas Edison worked hard. He was what you could call a “crank” inventor - trying every single combination til he found one that worked. He was highly practical: if it works, it works - otherwise, keep trying until it does.

Nikola Tesla on the other hand was extremely intuitive. He would sit in his lab visualizing, and solutions would just come at him in a flash. Surely, he worked hard as well - but not in the repetitive sense of Edison.

In spite of having diametrically opposed strategies, both inventors came to be successful in their own right. So there’s obviously not just one way of going about it. You gotta choose your own style.

Personally, my preference goes in cycles. There are times when I just feel like moving fast and breaking things. To throw enough mud at the wall until some of it sticks.

But more often than not I’m drawn to being introspective and thoughtful about my actions. Valuing order and big blocks of uninterrupted time as a strategy for figuring things out. 

In business, the first approach of being quick and reckless tends to be more effective in the short run. It gets you to where you want faster. 

"Zero to one" solutions, on the other hand, seldom come into being like that. They’re the result of someone’s clear vision. And then implementation with complete tunnel vision and laser like focus.

But casting all of that aside, flowing through life in harmony with the universe à la Wu Wei - in effortless action - is simply more pleasurable.

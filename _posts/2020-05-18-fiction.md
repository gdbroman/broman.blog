Non-fiction can provide some helpful tips about this or that.

But fiction can permanently change your life.

It’s the ultimate self-help.

Because nothing beats a good story.

It’s just how we’re wired.

Sorry, top 10-lists.

And you might think that’s naive: “How can possibly unreal events help me deal with real life?”

Well, one could argue that fiction is even more real - even more true - than reality. Because what are fictional stories but archetypes?

Fiction deals with problems that humans have struggled with throughout all times. A good fictional story is thus a distilled version of life. Hypertruth.

Also, if you want to become a better writer: study fiction authors.

The best writers primarily write fiction.

You won’t find them in the Business section at the bookstore.

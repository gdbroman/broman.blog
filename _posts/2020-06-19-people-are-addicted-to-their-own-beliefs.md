You know that feeling when you’re out hiking and you get lost? Maybe you’re hungry and don’t have much food left. You’re tired and want to go home.

Well, most of our awake time, we’re like that - just not as severely.

**We’re all tired and we’re all scared.**

I think this is why we get so easily hooked on our own beliefs. Limiting beliefs that provide comfort and safety - but only apparent such. 

Security blankets.

Thoughts such as, _“I could never do that”_ in the face of adversity, to let ourselves off the hook.

Because otherwise we would have to take responsibility! To work on our weak spots and get uncomfortable in the process. _And we don’t want that to happen - now do we? No thanks._

Instead, we whitewash our weaknesses with these stories about ourselves until they become true. Until it's _who we are_.

See, you’re the only one who requires to be fooled. And the worst part is: You are also the _easiest_ to fool.

So be careful of what you think.

You know that feeling when you’re out trekking and have lost the main trail?

Maybe you’re hungry and don’t have much food left.

You’re tired and just want to go home.

At that instance, you’re very easily manipulable.

Well, 90% of our waking time - we’re like that, just not as severely.

**We’re all tired and we’re all scared.**

People just want to be given a direction and told what to do.

This is why we get hooked on our own beliefs.

Limiting beliefs provide comfort and safety - but only apparent such.

They’re security blankets that don't actually secure you.

Beliefs such as, “I couldn’t do that”, which let you off the hook.

Because otherwise, that would mean that you would have to take responsibility! To work on our weaknesses and get uncomfortable in the process.

_And we don’t want that - do we? No thanks._

In the face of adversity we thus quickly fall back on thoughts such as, “that’s not something for me”, and “I wouldn’t want that anyway”.

We whitewash our weak spots with “that’s just the kind of person I am”.

And many times, we loop on these thoughts until they become true.

But they’re nonetheless rationalizations.

Lies and excuses.

See, an excuse only needs to be as strong as your mind is weak.

You’re the only one that requires being fooled.

And as many greats have previously pointed out:

You are the easiest to fool.

People don't try new and difficult things because they don't feel qualified enough to do so.

But you'll never be qualified enough.

Which means you'll never dare to try something new!

How unfortunate.

And I'm not here to tell you that you are qualified. No. You're probably as inexperienced and dumb as everyone else. Especially if it's in the context of some entrepreneurial or artistic endeavor.

Isn't that wonderfully relieving?

Basically, no one is qualified. We're all just stupid apes who like to assign some other stupid apes titles and certificates but that doesn't remove the fact that we're still just stupid apes.

The day you truly internalize this - that adults are just as clueless as children, that no one truly knows what's going on - is the day you are no longer imprisoned by impostor syndrome.

I thus deeply believe that what makes someone a successful entrepreneur is not so much a matter of technical skill or knowledge, but to the degree they've realized what Steve Jobs put in the following way:

> Life can be so much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people who were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.

This is why there are plenty of wicked smart people who could run their own business but don't. They don't believe it. Hence the saying "those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world usually do".

Succeeding as a creative thus boils down to courage. To be able to live with uncertainty. To acknowledge that - yeah I'm a complete moron, but gradually, I'll become less of a moron and eventually I'll figure it out! McKelvey Continues:

> There is a different skill set that is really underappreciated and that is the person who can act without certainty.
> 
> They can sit there and look at a problem that hasn't been solved and say: I don't know if this can be solved but I'm gonna try and I'm gonna keep trying and at some point everyone's gonna give up but sometimes they end up figuring it out. And usually figuring it out is not one thing it's 20 things or twelve things.

Whether it's starting a business, writing a book, becoming an actor or stand-up comedian - you'll have to eat shit for the first five years or so. You'll have to solve an seemingly never ending list of problems. Without any progress visible to the bystander. But you'll know. You'll know that you're learning the game.

And if you're still delusionally thinking that successful creatives waited to start until they were "ready" and that everything then was a walk in the park - consider the following quote by Elon Musk on starting companies:

> Running a start-up is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss. After a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends

Now. The next time you're presented with an opportunity that you feel unqualified for, think of what entrepreneur legend Richard Branson would have done:

> If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later!

How many are nailed into a coffin, never having discovered their truer self? Never having cultivated their inner essence and unique set of talents? To have merely gone through the motions? Accepting the path handed to them at birth? To have lived a life short of meaning?

If you are in your twenties, this, if anything, should scare you. Now is the time to get serious. This is when you're starting to discover what your inner talents and natural inclinations are. Moving forward, this has to be on your mind. Who are you?

But if you feel lost - like you don't know yourself, you probably have to spend some time alone. Thinking. Not checking Instagram. Isolate yourself, sit down and just think for a bit dammit! Your unconscious will slowly start informing you.

What thoughts naturally seep into your mind when you're up late at night? What kind of people do you look up to? What qualities do you see in them that you can already kind of see in yourself? This will tell you.

And if it doesn't, it's because you have too little life experience. Go travel! Try more things. Different jobs, lifestyles, philosophies. Then come back.

Lastly, when you've detected your core, you'll have to polish it. Train and integrate these abilities that make you you. Conquer and stick a flag in them.

This is your duty. Because meaning in your life depends on it.

It's the only good fight there is.

Why have fun?

Because it's fun! Obviously.

To be silly is human.

And yet, we like to think of modern man as someone very serious.

Because that's what it means to be an adult, isn't it?

Growing up is serious business.

To frown and tell kids to _"get your act together!"_

We have come to think of being serious as something good and silliness as something bad. That seriousness is what holds our civilization together.

**But here's a thought: maybe you can be silly AND get things done.**

One could even argue that it is silliness that has moved civilization to where it is today. And I think this is true.

Every innovator, entrepreneur, artist, writer, thinker and revolutionary have been incredibly silly people.

Because to be creative you have to cultivate your _inner child._ That part of you that hasn't got it's curiosity beaten out of it by society yet.

Besides, being serious is boring!

We could all need some more fun in our lives.

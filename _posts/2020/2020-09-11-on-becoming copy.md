For a system to change, and recursively change the way it changes itself, ad infinitum, seems logically impossible.

Yet, the mind does it all the time.

But for the purpose of realizing one's true nature, it does not really matter how. Becoming is not a matter of logic.

It's up to awareness to gain self-objectivity; and with it, resilience, kindness, wisdom; equanimity.

The cup empties itself.

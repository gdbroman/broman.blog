*You think it's about the reward, motherfucker?*

*Are you kidding me? I'm not.*

*Fuck you for perpetuating conditional happiness. You, me - we're all gonna die. This thing will blow by faster than you'll know, and then you'll lie there, six feet under without having realized who you are. A whole life thinking you're the water, not the the bowl.*

*Haven't you understood anything?*

*You think I am the outcome? Fuck you.*

Then I get angry for getting angry over such pity things outside of my control. *Haven't I understood anthing?*

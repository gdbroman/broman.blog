Being well-rounded isn't being dull or mediocre, is it?

*Is it?*

Those seeking to improve, face the dilemma of doubling down on strengths, or correcting weaknesses.

Squares acknowledge their weak spots to some degree, but circles dedicate their whole lives to it.

Excuse the sloppy shape analogy. I think the following distinction offers some clarity:

1. *Being well-rounded in skills*

    * This more of a binary thing. You're either well-read or not. And if you are, you may [T-specialize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills){:target="_blank"} and enjoy an awesome career.

2. *Being well-rounded emotionally*

    * This is a lifelong journey. A process of figuring out how you lie to yourself on a daily basis.

So my current thinking is this: Be T-shaped in your craft, but round personality-wise.

The former is simple: Find a passion - and read widely.

The latter is hard: Do things which make you uncomfortable.

* Some people hate socializing. They need to socialize.
* Some people hate running. They need to run.
* Some people hate pop music. Good for them.

Being round career-wise is financially dumb, but being round emotionally is probably the only antidote to subconscious sabotage.

We want to be seen *doing* the thing, *wanting* the thing, or *not wanting* the thing.

Also not caring about signaling is a form of signaling - inescapably! all we do is signal.

How many layers of meta-cognition would you like to obscure it with? This freedom we have.

But above all, we seek unconditional Love - especially those obscuring their signal. So really, Love is our Freedom.

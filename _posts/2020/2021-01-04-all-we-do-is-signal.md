There's wanting to be seen *doing* the thing.

There's wanting to be seen *wanting* to do the thing.

There's wanting to be seen *not wanting* to do the thing.

And on and on. Even not caring about signaling is a form of signaling - inescapable.

All we do is signal; With how many layers of meta-cognition would you like to obscure it with? This is all it is.

Wanting to be seen *doing* the thing.

Wanting to be seen *wanting* the thing.

Wanting to be seen *not wanting* the thing.

Also not caring about signaling is a form of signaling - inescapably! all we do is signal.

How many layers of meta-cognition would you like to obscure it with? This freedom we have.

Ultimately, we want to be seen - period! And thus, our biggest freedom is love.

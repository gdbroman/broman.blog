Choice is perhaps the worst thing one can possess.

There's no aim in an infinitely dimensional problem space.

You want rules and constraints.

Stories: *This is what I do, and this is who I am.*

So you don't have to solve a mystery every morning.

Ultimate freedom paralyzes, and eats you up alive.

Limitations enforce concentrated action.

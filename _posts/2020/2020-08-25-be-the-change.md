Everybody wanna change the world but ain't nobody wanna change themselves.

Criticizing is easy.

But until we realize our own agency, the storm won't settle.

When instead of judging other's for their shortcomings, we look for equivalent deficiencies in ourselves.

When instead of complaining about some system, we ask what we can do to improve it.

Never complain.

Never demand change in others.

Be the change you wish to see.

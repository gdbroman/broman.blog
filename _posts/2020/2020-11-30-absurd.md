Once upon a time, on a tiny speck,

Monkeys became self-aware, and now they're depressed.

So off they went, on a hunt for meaning,

In that larger than themselves.

And how they searched! But to no avail.

They had seen the absurd, and there was no going back.

They had tried with values - grandiouse and noble!

But absurdity always prevailed.

Hopelessness! Despair! What were their options?

To continue as regular? As if nothing had happened?

Not with pure will - not even death.

There is no unseeing - no avoiding, nor returning.

Ha! Give a chuckle?!

Madness! Fools! You have no heart, I say!

Tell me, why hold reason to such high regard?

You agree a hammer's a tool,

But reason - no - you've made it your god!

When it can't even provide, the most fundamental -

Meaning in life?

Time is brief, but we are not.

May I never mistake a hammer for God.

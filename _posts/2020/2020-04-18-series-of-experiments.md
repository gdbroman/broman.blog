Every person comes stumbling into this world, without a clue of what to do.

Gradually, your surrounding seems to get the hang of things. So you start pretending that you do aswell.

You get a job. Maybe a girlfriend. And go out on the weekend.

This is 99% of people's lives summed up.

But how much do you miss out on by stopping to experiment somewhere in your twenties?

How much more could you learn and experience if you never defaulted to pretending that you've learnt everything there is?

## Be Careful of Role Models

I reckon much of the pressure to start pretending (i.e. "adulting") early on, stems from all the successful role models we see in media.

Their success and confidence makes it seem like they've got it all figured out. But these entrepreneurs, actors and artists got to where they are because of experimenting!

Though, it doesn't seem that way, because you only see their success.

> Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has talked about this temptation. He reminds himself that there was "no aha moment" for his billion-dollar behemoth, no matter what he might read in his own press clippings.
> 
> The founding of a company, making money in the market or the formation of an idea is messy. Reducing it to a narrative retroactively creates a clarity that never was and never will be there.

> <cite>Ryan Holiday, _Ego is the Enemy_</cite>

Even people who you think hit the home run on their first try - didn't.

Bill Gates failed his first company Traf-O-Data.

But you've only heard of Microsoft.

Because people don't remember your failed experiments and you only need to win big once.

The time is thus always right for an experiment.

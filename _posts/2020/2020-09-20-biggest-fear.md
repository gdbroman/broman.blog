I don't fear self-delusion, I fear being ignorant of my self-delusion. Self-subjectivity: To know yourself worst.

To think you're incredibly self-aware, but de facto self-delusional. To be the only one blind to one's blindness. Shutter Island - that kind of thing.

I tell myself I have great self-confidence, yet I freeze up whenever I talk to beautiful women.

I tell myself I want to improve, yet I often self-sabotage whenever I get close to change.

I tell myself I'm conscious, yet I walk around in a continuous state of fight-or-flight.

This is how I lie to myself: To name things for what they are, so they hopefully, may not.

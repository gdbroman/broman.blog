We head to work, acting as if we've never heard of sex or shitting. *No sir - all neocortex here!*

As if we're not messy creatures, constantly driven by survival.

As if we're not scared it all could end at any moment - confused as to what we're supposed to do about it?

As if, not secretly afraid we're the only one experiencing this shitshow - or if everyone else is simply hiding it?

We're embarrassed by our own condition and look up to technology because it's clean and predictable.

Industrial society has taken on a life-form of its own, that can only be appropriately described as parasitism. It's made us adopt its goals in preference to our own.

Technology's our god and the robot our hero: Does exactly what it's told, without farting or complaining.

Sure, we're messy, vulnerable creatures. But as much as we'd like to, our truer nature cannot be overridden after only a couple of hundred years.

Being human is embarrassing - but only if we suppress it. Embracing it, one finds real beauty in it.

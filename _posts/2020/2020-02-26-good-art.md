_His slight limping indicated a lifetime of construction work. The groceries in his right hand were for him and his wife. They had been fighting. Hence the bouquet in his left hand: An attempt to resolve their long lived conflict._

I was about eleven years old and had just watched Sherlock Holmes at the movies. And I was now convinced that I had _superhuman deducing abilities._

From the moment I stepped my small foot out of the movie theater, I started _judging_ people. Trying to read them based on appearance. What shoes they wore, their hair style, walking style and lipstick. I was probably dead wrong 99% - nay, 100% - of the time. But that's not the point.

The point is that that movie, if only for an afternoon, _changed_ me. It affected my thinking to the point of delusion.

Sure, I was a kid. And it was temporary. And you might hate Sherlock Holmes. But still.

And that's what good art is. It's disruptive. It colors your consciousness. It takes your mind on a trip from here to there.

Good art is when you close that book or walk out of that theater and notice; that things are just a little bit different. It's slight. And you can't immediately put a finger on it. But it's there.

That's what good art does: It changes you.

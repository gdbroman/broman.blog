I used to subscribe to the motto, *"work hard in silence and let the results speak for themselves"* (*[Don't tell people about your goals](/dont-share-your-goals){:target="blank"})*. And while I still kind of hold my stance on that within the context of more grandiose projects, I've recently awakened to the power of learning in public.

What I mean by that is, **documenting your journey of development** in some area. It might mean:

- Writing book reviews on Goodreads, or publishing your Kindle notes & highlights
- Documenting the process of learning some skill on Youtube
- Publishing daily insights on a blog or social media platform (which is what I'm doing here)

Surely, this requires humility. Putting yourself out there can be scary. But it's not as bad as one might think.

When you read someone's helpful article or watch a vlog, do you think: *"What a goofball!"* Or, do you appreciate the insight he or she might have shared with you?

And the benefits are for both parties: Not only does learning in public help other's out, which can be rewarding in its own right, but the benefits for yourself are insanely practical.

The first set of benefits is independent of whether other's ever find your stuff:

- It forces you to be more active and intentional in your learning (see Feynman Technique)
- It helps you [discover what you think](https://broman.blog/know-what-you-believe){:target="blank"}
- It's fun to get a bird's-eye view of your progress

The second set of benefits requires people interacting with your content:

- Public thinking creates a positive feedback loop when other's interact with your ideas
- It builds an internet presence in a very effortless way
- It helps others out

Again, even if you publish for a ghost town, your future self will thank you for clearing up your thinking and communication.

Here are some good examples of people learning in public:

- [Daniel Bourke](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8O8l5cCX85Oem1d18EezQ){:target="_blank"} documenting his journey of becoming a machine learning engineer
- [Ruby Granger](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6a8lp6vaCMhUVXPyynhjUA){:target="_blank"} sharing her academic journey as a bookworm
- [Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/@bryan_johnson){:target="_blank"}'s newsletter on being a neuroscience tech startup founder

I just discovered Santa Claus doesn’t exist. And by Santa Claus I mean adults. Adults do not exist.

The other day I witnessed a man die. He was a neighbor of mine and we had had a pretty good relationship.

As I sat by his hospital bed, I felt relief. He was 95 years old and had been suffering lately. But I primarily felt uniquely present. Because at that moment I was once again reminded of the scarce nature of life. How we live out our days like we have an endless supply. As if we’ll always get another chance.

But we won’t - and we know we won’t. Some moment will have to be the last. But this reality is lost in the minutiae of everyday life. Except for in certain moments. Like in the presence of death.

As I walked out of the hospital room, having said goodbye, one visitor asked the doctor if the dying were able to hear us when we spoke to them. The doctor replied with *“they say that semi-conscious people can actually hear others even if they are unable to speak themselves”.* The visitor smiled, nodded and left.

*“THEY SAY”.* Who are *they*? Presumably people who have thought and studied the brain a lot. Researchers, professors, academics. Can you really know what someone’s subjective experience is, just through a brain scan? I reckoned it could give you a hint. Then I also nodded and left.

So much of civilized human existence relies on people who know what to do - how to do it - and when. We have made an abstraction around this called “adults”.

An “adult” is someone responsible. Someone who you can rely on and who can answer your questions. Someone who gets things done and knows how stuff works.

When the car gets broken down, we call a competent mechanic to fix it for us. An *adult* car mechanic.

Whenever there’s some sort of crisis we turn on the TV or go on the internet, listen to news anchors and experts to tell us what’s up. Once again we turn to adults.

When someone’s dying, we turn to the doctor for status reports. To answer our questions.

It seems like we are surrounded by adults. But at a second glance it becomes obvious that this is merely an illusion. Social dynamics tricking your brain. Let us for a moment think about what we *don’t* see.

What you don't see is that the skilled car mechanic is also clueless with women.

That the confident news anchor on TV recently had a fight with her husband and is now living with her mother.

That the knowledgeable doctor who you turned to for answers is depressed, prays to God every night, and is as clueless as you about what death really entails.

We do not see these things because people never share them. They are what we call *“private”.* **Modern man is thus living a doubled life:** One private and one public.

At home we get to do what we like. Watch our embarrassing TV-shows, dance shamelessly, sing and cry. We get to be ourselves. But the moment we step out our front door, a *shell* is put on. A shell in the form of achievements, conveniently hiding our flaws. We turn *“professional”*.

We smile and tell everyone about what’s going so great in our lives. Never revealing our bad sides, because that would make us vulnerable. Consequently, **we perceive everyone else as flawless, happy human beings. Whereas we can only verify how untrue that is for ourselves.**

Living this sort of doubled life is very unfortunate for everyone’s - but especially our own - wellbeing. Because while comfortable to hide our shortcomings in the moment, it will ultimately make us feel what you might choose to call "unwhole”. Superficial. A fraud always on the verge of being found out. Not being ourselves. Never *finding* ourselves.

I’m not suggesting we immediately start running around naked, shouting out our quirky secrets. Because most likely, that’s not something you’d identify with neither. Instead, one might propose to unify your “public” and “private” selves as much as possible. Maybe they can meet somewhere in the middle.

This might mean letting loose a bit more in public, and at the same time taking your alone time more seriously. To reveal something embarrassing you did yesterday to your co-worker, and read a novel instead of watching TV before bed. Maybe even contemplate death à la the stoics. Internalizing the scarcity of life will give you a great deal of courage - enough to be vulnerable.

Yesterday I realized that the adult is a myth. That it is an unreachable abstraction. And everyone you think of as responsible, perfect or knowledgeable, you probably just need to spend some more time around. A genius is just someone you haven’t got to know yet.

But it is through bridging the gap between our two selves that we can mature. Not wearing a shell as a fear response, but instead cultivating a solid personality that is constant throughout all environments - regardless of who’s watching. To become whole.

That is what it should mean to become an adult.

Everyone has

1. A boss, and
2. A teacher

Some find it disappointing when they find out that the *"guru"* in their domain who they've looked up to for so long has just been repeating lesson's from *his* teacher.

But the master's master is not necessarily better.

Different - and *sometimes* better, but most often that teacher's teacher was simply a better fit for your teacher. And *your* teacher a better fir for *you*. Teaching is all about combability.

There's no new lessons under the sun. Only new perspectives and new forms of packaging.

Good artists borrow and great artists steal. It's about how you steal.

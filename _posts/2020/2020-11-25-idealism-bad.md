Man is not perfectible - so we're just gonna shoot the guy who promises otherwise? What are we doing here??

I get it; the road to hell is paved with good intentions, etc.

But so is the road to heaven - no? And not a single road paved with *bad* intentions lead anywhere desirable - does it?

Yes or yes?

Let me tell you this; there's nothing sadder than an old cynic.

You don't wanna be the guy laughing on doomsday. People crying and you yelling *"I told you!"* in all the their faces.

Rather die a young idealist.

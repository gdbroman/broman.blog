Man is not perfectible - so we're just gonna shoot the guy who promises otherwise?

What are we doing here?

I get it; the road to hell is paved with good intentions, etc.

But so is the road to heaven - no?

And not a single road paved with *bad* intentions lead anywhere desirable, does it?

Yes or yes?

There's nothing sadder than an old cynic.

You don't wanna be the guy laughing on doomsday, yelling *"I told you so!"* in all the naive people's crying faces.

Rather die a young idealist.

A karate kid walked up to the black belt and asked excitedly, *"how do I get as good as thou?"*

*"Ah, there's not much to it"* said the black belt. *"It's just practice. But don't bother, you'll give up soon enough."*

*"You watch! I'll invent new kicks, do moves never before imagined. I'll become the greatest master who's ever lived! I'll show you!"* said the beginner.

Ten years later the beginner had received a black belt. Then a new white belt walked up to him:

*"Oh master, how do I get as good as thou?"*

*"Practice 12 hours a day for ten years and you may receive a black belt like me."*

The new white belt did as told and after ten years he recieved a black belt. With a scissor he instantly cut it in half and went to become a musician.

He was now the greatest karate master who had ever lived.

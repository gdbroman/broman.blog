Analogous to the fish becoming ignorant of the medium they're constantly in, the banalities of life often make us forget why we're here. What we're supposed to do. How to not be miserable.

It can be easy to identify with the greek mythology of Sisyphus. Destined for rolling a massive boulder uphill. Day in and out, only to have the boulder roll back down when he finally reaches the top. And then to do it again, and again.

**But Sisyphus eventually comes to terms with his destiny. Making a conscious shift in attitude, from suffering to thriving. Embracing the repetitive nature of life. And so can we.**

We can assign meaning to our tasks at hand, no matter how dull or seemingly meaningless. Because everything we do matters.

It's up to ourselves to assign meaning, and this is water.

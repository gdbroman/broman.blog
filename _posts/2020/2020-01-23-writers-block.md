There's 30 minutes left to hand in your thesis and you haven't even started yet. You're staring at the blank page with an increasing feel of frustration together with a hint of - nay, full bucket of - panic. Why can't you think of anything? 

Your head's empty. Not even the slightest idea will present itself. Nothing, _nichts, nada_. You're desperate but slowly start to come to terms with the reality that your life is soon and finally over. This is how it all ends. And there's nothing to be done.

That's writer's block for you. Well...You get the idea. Maybe you're a blogger, professional writer or student who sometimes just get irritated when you can't get yourself to write. Down below I share some thoughts that might help you out. Most of these can also be applied to fight procrastination in general.

## Don't Macro Stop

Writing's a funny thing. Sometimes the words just flow and other times you can't conjure up a single sentence even if your life depended on it. So here's a fairly obvious but not commonly utilized tip: don't stop! When a flow settles - don't let it flee!

You stop - and you become stupid. You gotta keep moving. That's the surest way to keep up creativity and continue learning at a high pace. Use the idea muscle or it atrophies. And when you're constantly in motion, you eliminate procrastination all together because you never need to ask yourself about taking action or not.

A good example of this technique in practice is navy seal David Goggins who eats ultramarathons for breakfast everyday. This is a guy who runs for 24 hours in the desert without sun cream nor water and who's been named "the toughest man alive". You'd think he likes running right? Well you'd be wrong! He actually hates running. But still, he continues to do it. Every. Single. Day.

So how is Goggins able to keep such a consistency? Easy: he never gives himself an out. He does this by placing his running shoes and training clothes right next to the side of his bed. He then puts them on, first thing in the morning; no questions asked.

When you don't allow yourself to stop you never need to face the battle of starting up all over again.

Okay, how does this apply to writing? It doesn't mean you should try to write 24/7 but it can be helpful to habituate it. You can experience flow on both a macro and a micro level. On the micro level it's gonna come in spurts and you're gonna have to let it go after each session.

But in order to keep a macro flow that aids your consistency, you'll need a routine. Set a maximum time-limit in between your writing. Make a rule for yourself that you will not wait for more than, say 24 hours, in between writing sessions. The easiest way to accomplish this is by writing at the same time every single day. And it doesn't have to be much. It is he who has practiced one kick 10,000 times, not 10,000 kicks once, who'll come out on top.

## Write Something That's Pure Garbage

Procrastination is often the result of perfectionism. When putting something off, you're probably thinking that you'll do a bad job. And YES! You will. You'll most likely suck. But the best thing to do is to embrace it. Just lower your standards, man.

Telling yourself that you won't produce anything unless it's absolutely perfect might seem like a good thing. Why not strive for perfection? But, guess what? With that attitude you'll never write a single word. Perfectionism is the biggest enemy of getting things done.

Instead, tell yourself that you're going to write whatever comes to mind and that it's going to be bad. You might even try to consciously make it bad. At least then you got something to edit and work with. That way the process also becomes less serious-feeling and more fun.

It's easier turning something bad into something good than it is to create something good from scratch. No one succeeds on their first try.

Ironically however, by lowering your standards, you'll eventually end up with better results than the perfectionists. This is because you will get more practice time and thus become more skilled.

People of action know that he who has 99 failures but 1 success under his belt is far more successful than he with 0 of both. 1 is better than 0. Stasis is for dead people.

## It's Mostly Output

> If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.

That's a quote from Stephen King. And I'm not disagreeing with a legend. Reading and writing are the top two activities for improving on your writing. But I would still like to nuance that a bit. Because guess what the best thing for improving your writing is? WRITING.

Pondering, reading, gathering ideas and studying other's styles is certainly good, but don't do it exclusively. If you have to choose between reading and writing - just write. Prioritize output over input. In fact, I can't think of any skill where this doesn't apply (except reading in and of itself).

Are you in love with the craft - or the *idea* of the craft?

Unfortunately, but not surprisingly - because we are culturally pressured to make a career choice so early in life - with such little experience - the latter is more common.

* Did you choose to study law because you love it - or because you like the *IDEA* of being a highly paid, respected lawyer?
* Did you choose to become a mathematician because you spend most of your awake time thinking about math problems - or because you like the romantic notion of being a troubled genius with a PhD title?
* Did you choose to put 'entrepreneur' in your bio because you're constantly trying out business ideas - or because that label is hip right now?

You get the idea.

*What do you do when your calendar's blank, and no one's looking?* What would you do, if you had to spend the rest of your life on a deserted island?

**For many, the craft, and the *idea* of the craft, have been mixed up for so long that it requires some serious soul-searching to separate them clearly again.**

Because it starts out clear as day: When we're kids, we carelessly do whatever we're naturally drawn towards. Then you learn that some things are more *desirable* to do than others. So we morph our interests as to not get outcast.

Until you've reobtained that childish clarity of what craft you're supposed to do, you're nothing but a cultural pawn.

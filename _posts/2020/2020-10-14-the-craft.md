Are you in love with the craft - or the *idea* of the craft?

Not surprisingly - because we are culturally pressured to make a career choice so early in life - with such little experience - the latter is more common.

* Did you choose to study law because you love it - or because you like the *IDEA* of being a highly paid, respected lawyer?
* Did you choose to become a mathematician because most of your awake time you're thinking about math problems - or because you like the *romantic notion* of being that troubled genius with a PhD title?
* Did you choose to put 'entrepreneur' in your bio because you're constantly trying out business ideas - or because that label is *hip* right now?

*What do you do when your calendar's blank, and no one's looking?* What *would* you do, for the rest of your life on a deserted island?

**For many, the craft, and the *idea* of the craft, have been mixed up for so long that it requires some serious soul-searching to begin separating them clearly again.**

It starts out clear as day: When we're kids, we pursue whatever we're naturally drawn towards. Then we're taught that some professions are more *desirable* than others. So we morph our interests as to not get outcast.

Until reobtaining that childish clarity, we're nothing but cultural pawns.

Potential more a moon,

than everglowing star.

At times deeply hidden -

how murky clouds, they are!

Sometimes others see,

and we? No, nothing at all.

It requires unraveling,

in our mind's eye.

You prefer blind traveling?

Ha - I think I'd rather die!

I, my own cheerleader,

as well as worst critic.

Seeing what could be,

and oh, so far a way.

This is my journey.

I mustn't go astray.

We get back up because staying down is even more painful. 

Getting beat down is a part of life, so you better learn how to pick yourself up. To fail and recommit. Fail, recommit. Fail, recommit. The next time a little bit easier than the last. As David Goggins would have said; hardships callouses your mind.

In his book, _Can't Hurt Me_, Goggins talks about how he's learned to be brutally honest with himself. He has this exercise called the accountability mirror which he began as a teenager, growing up in an abusive family.

You simply stare into the mirror and brutally call yourself out. Goggins would look at his reflection and say, _“You’re fat, you’re lazy, and you’re a liar. What are you going to do about it?”_

And when he couldn't pass any of his reading classes in the military he would somewhat comically tell himself:

> Goggins, you're a dumb motherfucker.
> 
> Roger that. Read it again.

To be brutally honest about your weaknesses. And then go to work on them.

_But can't this become a dangerous, toxic game to play? Can't this honesty turn into self loathing?_

Yes. Yes it can. But Goggins doesn't adress it in his book and I think I know why. It's the same reason why he get's pissed off listening to academics talking about human being's biological limits.

It's not that he doesn't believe in science. He just recognizes that most people aren't even close to their limits. Those kinds of discussions can thus come to serve as an easy out. He knows, because he used to be one of those people himself.

Most people are soft. Or at least, so Goggins claim. They're closer to being too easy than too hard on themselves. And how will you gain self-respect if you haven't put in the hours? If you can, that's awesome. But most need to earn it through accountability.

There are all these areas in which we start at zero.

Health, money, relationships, etc.

And then you can level up. Not even a cap - just a time limit.

With freedom to experiment and develop our own strategies.

Sounds kind of fun - doesn’t it?

Why wouldn’t you want to climb as high as possible?

But I know I’m cheating.

Because this is simply not how you see things at a lower level.

Like, if you’re depressed, you don’t see a point in playing the game at all.

Why bother? It’s all just a stupid game that’ll end soon enough anyway.

How do you even answer that?

You can’t say: “Because it’s a hell of a lot better than whining about it and feeling sorry for yourself”.

Such a statement already requires a hierarchy of meaning.

And a nihilist doesn’t believe in such things, does he?

It’s funny.

Is it just me or do those who flirt with nihilism play an awful lot of video games?

Whereas those who adopt this playful mentality have no need for that.

Because nothing beats life: The best game there will ever be.

> Deep Learning is not AI. Deep Learning is a class of highly useful algorithms for automating statistical modeling. Almost none of its practitioners entertain ideas about the mind and intelligence, the way Minsky, Turing or Newell did.

It might seem like the field of artificial intelligence is making great progress at the moment. But it’s a mess.
Glorified statistics labeled with buzzwords.

And now also a lucrative career option, attracting people who have no remote interest in the nature of intelligence to take some Udemy courses. It’s useful for specialized applications, no doubt. But let's not forget why we started. 

Because whilst useful, machine learning is also very boring! It doesn’t require any deeper philosophical understanding of the problems themselves. No understanding of the mind, its processes and relation to reality. And at some point we’ll have to move on to another paradigm if we seek to create artificial general intelligence.

Marvin Minsky, Douglas Hoftstadter and Joscha Bach - this is the kind of thinking that’ll take us closer to AGI. Not f-ing linear regression.

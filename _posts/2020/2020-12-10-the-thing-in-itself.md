Friedrich had been having trouble with finding ground under foot lately, so in a last attempt to restore some sanity he called up an old friend for advice.

BUDDHA: *Yes, this is Buddhahood?*

NIETZSCHE: *Language, sensations, concepts - at most, these are useful metaphors.*

BUDDHA: *Amazing - yes go on, please.*

NIETZSCHE: *Words -*

BUDDHA: *Thank you.*

NIETZSCHE: *Words - they provide relations. But to mistake language - a human product - with what is...is nothing short of anthropocentrism.*

BUDDHA: Yes.

NIETZSCHE: *Concepts arise from the equation of ultimately unequal things. This is where human hubris lives.*

BUDDHA: *Mmm. Very good. I can sense you are almost there. But like the forms, you're busy pointing! May I ask, have you ever tried observing?*

NIETZSCHE: *All perception starts out as nerve stimuli, but at that instance, it - whatever that is - has already left the
thing in itself and turned into a representation.*

BUDDHA: *Have you tried observing this moment? And...this?*

NIETZSCHE: *The distinction between the general - such as time - and individual instance - such as now - is also dogmatic. If it originates from the nature of things, we cannot know. Nonetheless, I shall do as you ask and observe nature with my own mind's eye.*

BUDDHA: *And?*

Ans so they were. Not forms, nor conepts. Monistic, eternal - one and forever. Here we are.

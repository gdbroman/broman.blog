Friedrich had been having troubles with finding ground under foot lately, so in a last attempt to restore some sanity he called up a friend for advice.

BUDDHA: *Yes, this is Buddhahood?*

NIETZSCHE: *Language, sensations, concepts - at most, these are useful metaphors.*

BUDDHA: *Amazing - yes go on, please.*

NIETZSCHE: *Words -*

BUDDHA: *Thank you.*

NIETZSCHE: *Words - they provide relations, yes. but to mistake language - a human product - with what is, is nothing short of anthropocentrism.*

BUDDHA: *Mmm. Very good.*

NIETZSCHE: *Concepts arise from the equation of ultimately unequal things. This is where human hubris lives.*

BUDDHA: *I can sense you are almost there. But like the forms, the very trap you're talking about - you happily step into them!*

NIETZSCHE: *Happy? Buddha please, I call you because that is the thing I am least of all!*

BUDDHA: *The trap is pointing at itself! Haha, yes - traps all the way down. May I ask, have you ever tried simply observing?*

NIETZSCHE: *All perception starts out as nerve stimuli, but at that instance it - whatever that is - has already left the
thing in itself and turned into representation.*

BUDDHA: *Indeed, forms can point us towards it, and it is not accessible through second derivate relations. So I ask you once again, have you ever tried observing this very moment? And this - what about this one?*

NIETZSCHE: *The distinction between general concept and individual instance is also dogmatic. If it originates from the nature of things, we cannot know. Nonetheless, I shall do as you ask and observe nature with my mind's eye.*

BUDDHA: *And?*

NIETZSCHE: *Nothing.*

BUDDHA: *And?*

NIETZSCHE: *Everything.*

BUDDHA: *And?*

NIETZSCHE: *Mmm.*

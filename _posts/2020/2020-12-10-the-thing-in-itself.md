NIETZSCHE: Language, sensations, concepts - at most, these are useful metaphors.

BUDDHA: Amazing - yes go on, please.

NIETZSCHE: Words -

BUDDHA: Thank you.

NIETZSCHE: Words - they provide relations, yes. but to mistake language - a human product - with what *is*, is nothing short of anthropocentrism.

BUDDHA: Mmm. Very good.

NIETZSCHE: Concepts arise from the equation of ultimately unequal things. This is where human hubris lives.

BUDDHA: I can sense you are almost there. But just like the forms, the very trap you're talking about, you step into. The trap is pointing at itself! Haha, yes - traps all the way down. May I ask, have you ever tried simply observing?

NIETZSCHE: All perception starts out as nerve stimuli, but at that instance *it* - whatever that is - has already left the
thing in itself and turned into representation.

BUDDHA: Indeed, forms can point us towards it, and it is not accessible through second derivate relations. So I ask you once again, have you ever tried observing this very moment? And *this* - what about this one?

NIETZSCHE: The distinction between general concept and individual instance is also dogmatic. If it originates from the nature of things, we cannot know. Nonethess, I shall do as you ask and observe nature with my mind's eye.

BUDDHA: And?

NIETZSCHE: Mmm.

Why does being "employable" sometimes feel so orthogonal to being human?

Forcing a smile for the job interviewer, talking about your love for this and that void-of-meaning corporate buzzword. Claiming natural giftedness for teamwork and office socializing, even though you’re an awkward recluse if there ever was one.

You're sitting there with a bright flickering LED lamp in your face thinking, _is this what we’re supposed to do? Is this humanity at its peak: Packed inside rectangular shaped cement blocks during the day’s most precious hours?_ You don’t say that of course - or that would be _unprofessional_. Instead you go on about how you, as an [insert bullshit corporate title here] _love_ what you do (despite never using that word even for your family), how you’re always on time and do not shy away from working hard (sort of implicitly communicating that you indeed will do as you’re told and be an office slave from nine to five every weekday and maybe also on weekends).

And then when you’re employed; returning home in the evening with 90% of your mental energy already depleted, using those remaining 10% to microwave some pre-processed food and mindlessly consume social media news feeds, steadily lowering your consciousness until your thoughts are down to _“hungry"_, _"snacks”_ and _“Netflix”_. Then waking up the next morning to once again squeeze yourself together amongst hundreds of other stressed workers on their way to rectangular cement blocks. Run, squeeze, Netflix. And then you die.

Dystopian? A bit, I’ll admit. I'm definitely not being _professional_, that's for sure. In fact, if a recruiter were to read this, I’d probably be removed from that company’s hiring list.

What being employable really means might be thought of as a sort of _artificial humanism_. The perfect employee is what you’d get if you instructed a robot to act human: An incapability with negative emotions, only displaying good will and enterprise. It's really quite simple: If you feel sad, stuff it inside and only let it out when there are no witnesses. Some emotions are even better if you yourself don’t acknowledge: _Finding work soul-destroyingly boring? Of course you aren’t!_

And thanks to the publicity of the internet, you'll need to keep your “employability ranking” in mind even when you're on platforms that are supposedly not work-related, since _anything you say on the internet may be used against you in the court of hiring._ Everything you post can be found with a quick Google search - and the recruiter _will_ Google search, mind you - so better stay professional.

The alternative is employing yourself.

Doing the work - whilst indifferent to the outcome.

It seems like, only in the west, do we struggle wrapping our heads around such contradictory concepts. We want rules that apply 100% of the time - otherwise it's an *oxymoron, dammit!*

But easterners don't seem to have much trouble with it at all: Always a yin and a yang; no need to straighten something out that's inherently curvy.

It's really not confusing. Being engaged and detached, is simply valuing process over outcome; journey over destination.

Giving your very best but not expecting one iota in return: I think this is a healthy mindset.

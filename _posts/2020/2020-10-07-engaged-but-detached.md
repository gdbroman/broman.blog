Doing the work - whilst indifferent to the outcome.

It seems like, only in the west, do we struggle wrapping our heads around these contradictory concepts. We want rules that apply 100% of the time, otherwise it's an *oxymoron - dammit!*

Easterners don't seem to have much trouble with it: Always a yin and a yang. No need to straighten something out that's inherently curvy.

It's really not confusing. Being engaged but detached, is valuing process over outcome; journey over destination.

Giving your all but not expecting one iota in return. I think this is a healthy mindset.

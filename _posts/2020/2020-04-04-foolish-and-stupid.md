Social pressure is a very real thing.

And at the same time - it's not.

It can _feel_ very real.

Realer than anything else.

But it's all in your head.

A product of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.

Conditioning. Telling you not to deviate.

To play it safe and stick to the tribe.

Why is that?

Well, historically, if you lost the tribe's trust you ran the risk of getting ejected.

And we all know what that meant: Not reproducing. Or, even worse - death.

That baloney is still baked into our genes! How crazy is that?

That whenever we want to try something new that's a little bit risky or difficult - our lizard brains interprets it as a death threat and induces a corresponding fear response!

This fear has long been effective for the survival of the human species.

But for the individual's self realization - not so much.

Because all learning, and everything worthwhile in life, involves risk.

Risk in the form of looking dumb, getting rejected, being humiliated or alone.

First, you need to accept how little you know. Then you need to keep going despite the discomfort of ignorance whilst trying to learn.

The good news is, unlike other animals, humans are capable of rational decision making.

We can choose to try scary and difficult stuff because we know intellectually that it's not really life threatening in today's society, despite what our lizard brains are trying to tell us.

Your friends and family will still love you, even if you don't succeed with whatever you're trying to accomplish.

I'm not claiming that it's easy.

**Social conformity is arguably among the strongest of human desires.**

So, if you're just starting out, there'll be a voice in your head telling you not to do it.

No matter your creative endeavor, this primal voice will be trying to convince you that you can't do it. That you'll embarrass yourself.

And it can be really convincing at times.

But the key is to not listen.

To do it anyways.

In spite of fear.

That's the definition of courage.

And after a while, the voice gets quieter. As well as your surroundings.

You'll just become that guy who's recognized for carving his own path: "It's just who he is, he's a little bit weird like that."

Maybe people will even respect you for it.

But that's of lesser importance.

What matters is that you'll know.

You'll know that you are living your life.

Feeling alive.

And there's no other feeling like it.

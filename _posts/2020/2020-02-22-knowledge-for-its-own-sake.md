How to live. That is a question, surprisingly few are actively trying to answer these days.

It is the question philosophy originally was all about. But it has long been forgotten since academia adopted the motto 'knowledge for knowledge's own sake'. The typical academic has gone from being a curious practitioner to a kind of distanced observer.

My personal curiosity in reading Plato or Dostoyevsky lies not in the interest of ancient Athens or 19th century Russia. It's purely selfish. I wan't to figure out how to live and die well.

And I think this curiosity, at least initially, is within all of us. But it get's sucked out in school and at work.

And understandably so! Who would want to pick up an old, difficult tome if it's information will have no use in your own day-to-day life? If your precious time invested will have no return?

But this is merely an issue of perspective. Because knowledge - and especially ancient such, that has stood the test of time - has a use. A very real use. Because if you let it, it'll teach you how to live.

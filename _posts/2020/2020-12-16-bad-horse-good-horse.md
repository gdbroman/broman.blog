In *Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind*, Suzuki asks; would you rather be a bad horse or a good horse? Naturally, we’d all want to be a good horse.

His point? It does not matter what we choose. But also, the bad one is better.

For the same reason, I think bad parents are the best parents. Good childhoods do not equip people for life.

It is the imperfections that motivate our way-seeking.

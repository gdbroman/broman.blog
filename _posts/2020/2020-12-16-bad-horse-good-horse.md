In *Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind*, author Shunryū Suzuki asks; would you rather be a bad horse, or a good horse?

Naturally, we’d all want to be a good horse.

*But* - he says - it does not matter what we choose. And the bad horse is also better. This is Zen.

Analogously, bad parents are the best parents. A good childhood does not equip for life.

*Parents? Horses? Where are we going?*

Here: Imperfection is our carrot.

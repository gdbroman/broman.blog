If you're somewhat smart, there's a big trap of conformity. You're expected to tread one of a handful laid out paths.

Go to the same good school as everyone else, choose the same career, live in the same area, and so on. And when someone bright doesn't walk a preset path, we say *"what a waste!"*

If you have the same set of experiences as everyone else, you're gonna make the same connections.

We wear clothes others made, we eat food others cook, we use technology others have invented. Constantly taking from that giant pool.

One of the best feelings there is, is putting something back into the pool.

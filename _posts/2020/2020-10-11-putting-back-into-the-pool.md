If you're somewhat smart (in the conventional sense of the word), there's a big trap of conformity. You're expected to tread one of a handful laid out paths.

Go to the same good school, chase the same career, live in the same area. And when someone bright doesn't walk a preset path, we say *"what a waste!"*

If you have the same set of experiences as everyone else, you're gonna make the same connections.

We wear clothes other people make, eat food other people cook, and use technology other people invent. Always taking from that giant pool.

One of the best feelings there is, is doing the whole poet in paris-thing, and then putting something back into the pool.

If you're somewhat smart (in the conventional sense of the word), there's a big trap of conformity. You're expected to tread one of a handful laid out paths.

Going to the same good school as everyone else, chasing the same career, living in the same area, etc. And when someone bright doesn't walk a preset path, we say *"what a waste!"*

If you have the same set of experiences as everyone else, you're gonna make the same connections.

We wear clothes others make, eat food others cook, use technology others invent. Constantly taking from that giant pool.

One of the best feelings there is, is putting something back into the pool.

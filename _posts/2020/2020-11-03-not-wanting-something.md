Having it means another background program running in your brain. Thinking about it, taking care of it, worrying about it, etc.

*Not* wanting it, closes the loop.

Or so minimalists, and tangential nutcases such as myself, would argue.

Is this simply fear of commitment manifesting? As long as it's only applied to *stuff*, and not people, it seems healthy.

I'm not sure.

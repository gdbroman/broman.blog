*Having it* means another background program in the brain.

Thinking about it, taking care of it, worrying about it, etc.

*Not wanting it*, closes the loop.

Or so minimalists, and tangential nutcases such as myself, would argue.

Is this simply fear of commitment manifesting?

As long as this thinking is only applied to *stuff*, and not people, it seems healthy.

I'm not sure.

_You gotta learn the right technique or you'll snap your back doing deadlifts!_

So what's the right technique for blogging, Youtube or podcasting? Unlike physical exercise I'd argue there's just one single technique to rule them all: Vulnerability.

To be open about your flaws, shortcomings and failures. A perfect example of this is James Altucher.

So why is being vulnerable so effective? My take is this: Because we are all basically the same. At least in terms of our bad experiences.

* We all have embarrassing failures
* We all have an imperfect childhood
* We all have a quirky part of our personality that we almost never dare to show in daylight
* We all have periods of anxiety, depression or some other negative feeling.

This is the human condition. And it's so obvious when you say these things. But yet, almost no one ever does say it.

And _that's_ why it's so effective! It's like a breath of fresh air when someone finally does acknowledge what it means to be human.

Being a good marketer is thus analogous to being a good comedian. Because it's often said that what makes a comedian effective is that he says what's on everybody's mind, but no one dares to say. People are afraid of being judged so it's a relief when someone finally dares to speak their mind.

Take a look at these two different bios:

### Bio #1

* Stanford, Harvard and MIT valedictorian
* Sold trendy startup for 3 trillion dollars
* Owner of the New York Jets
* ex-Facebook, ex-Google CEO
* Have written 30 NYT bestsellers

### Bio #2

> I’ve started 20 companies, 17 of which have failed. But I’ve learned a lot along the way.
> 
> If you’ve ever been stuck—in a job you hate, in a house you can’t afford, in a life you don’t want, in your own depressed mind, anything—I want to help you.
> 
> Why? Because I get it. I’ve been there. And I wantto tell you how I freed myself so maybe you can start to free yourself, too.

What's the difference in your reaction to these? If you're like most people, your reaction to Bio #1 would probably be:

> What an robotic alien! I could never do that.

Whereas the second one would make you exclaim:

> Finally - an actual human - just like me! I want to hear more.

By the way, the first bio is obviously fictional whereas the second one is from Altucher's blog.

The lesson here is that when you're writing your bio, don't just list your accomplishments. It's superficial and unrelatable. Instead, tell your personal story whilst focusing on how you overcame your struggles.

Now, of course there should be a balance. You can't completely ignore your accomplishments or else you run the risk of loosing credibility.

## Bleeding Is Surprisingly Liberating

In accordance with Ernest Hemingway's quote, _"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed"_, you'll notice that, whilst initially painful, it's a form of self realization.

You learn to come to terms with who you really are. To not be afraid of opening yourself up. And when you're not anymore imprisoned by other's judgement it can come to serve as a form of liberation.

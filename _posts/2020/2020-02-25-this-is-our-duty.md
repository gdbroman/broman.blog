How many are nailed into a coffin, never having discovered their higher self? Never having cultivated their inner essence and unique set of talents? To have merely gone through the motions, accepted the path handed to them at birth, and lived a life void of meaning?

If you are in your twenties, this - if anything - should scare you. Now is the time to get serious. This is when you're starting to discover what your inner talents and natural inclinations are. Moving forward, this has to be on your mind. Who are you?

What thoughts naturally seep into your mind when you're up late at night? What kind of people do you look up to? What qualities do you see in them that you can already kind of see in yourself? This will tell you.

And if it doesn't, maybe you're short on life experience. Go travel and try more things. Go taste, then come back.

When we've find our core, we have to polish it. Train and integrate these abilities that make you _you_. Conquer and stick a flag in them.

This is our duty, because meaning in life depends on it. And it's the only good fight there is.

Going meta is an awesome conversational tool.

If you ever find yourself in a boring conversation - try arising one level in the abstraction hierarchy. Here’s some examples:

Stale person: “Oh, did you hear about X getting divorced?”

You: “Why is it that we enjoy gossip so much?”

Another dull person: “You’re wrong! My political opinion is far superior!”

You: “Hmm. Do you think politics is a helpful tool for improving society? How would you define it? Is it just being opinionated? In other words, something innate in human nature? Or is it something we’ll eventually get rid of in pursuit of something more effective?”

Even the most dry of conversations will light up.

But is there ever a reason not to go meta?

(Well, in conversations you’ve got to choose your moments wisely, to not come across as a smartass.)

But in life, we either have the choice of playing all these games.

Of money. Career. Relationships and power.

Or you can choose to go meta.

By figuring out why there even is a game to begin with?

To try and understand the underlying structure.

These are two very different things.

It’s like trying to figure out how Mario Kart works instead of wishing to win the race.

But once you’ve figured out how the software runs there’s a chance you’ll be capable of becoming really good at the game.

So why not do that first?

Not so fast.

**There’s a chance that you’ll find the underlying structure so fascinating that playing becomes silly in comparison.**

Like, how finding out Santa Claus doesn’t exist, removes some of Christmas’ magic.

So there’s a risk.

And I think many sense it.

So they don’t bother.

They’re too invested in the game.

It’s like with all other stories.

Nations are a good example.

Try to convince a nationalist or a self-proclaimed “proud citizen” that their pride is based on nothing but fiction.

Note that I’m not making an argument against nationalism per se.

But most won’t recognize that a nation even is a story to begin with.

Understandably so.

It would mean that you’ve unconsciously been operating on a false plane of existence.

That you'd have to start questioning a whole host of other stories.

That a part of your reality, and by extension, ego - dies. *And we don’t want to let that happen - now do we?*

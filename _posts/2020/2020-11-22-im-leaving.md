I'm crying as I'm writing this, and I'm not even sure why. Nostalgia, I guess. It's in moments like these you get to pause, and reflect on your whole life's journey so far.

It's been about three months of solo traveling, and at last, I'm leaving for Canada. It has probably been my life's most important chapter yet. I'm wondering what the next chapter will bring.

I'm thinking about my days in grade school - the friends I made. I'm thinking about some of the more meaningful trips I've done - the insights they've spurred. Most of the episodic memories are of a bunch of mundanities, colored with love: Standing up for your best friend, or the electric text exchange with your crush. Things you didn't think much of in the moment, but that clung on as emotional passengers.

It's clear what is meaningful in retrospect. Not the surface-level vacations, or escapism activities. Not necessarily the most joyful moments - hard mountain hikes, ambitious projects, and odd conversations. Moments of courage, love - dread and despair. The challenges: Because whether we turn them around or not, through them we nonetheless go. Exiting; more present beings.

I just finished the book *Vagabonding* and am already thinking about what my next trip will be. I want to road trip across the US and hike in the national parks. I want to walk the woods of Canada. I want to surf in Hawaii. I want to speak to melancholic Russians, and see more of Asia. I want to explore the rainforests and savannahs of Africa - climb Kilimanjaro - and meditate in India. I want to take a boat to Antarctica. I want to do Ayahuasca in Peru.

It's in moments like these - it becomes clear how much of your life's circumstances you did not choose. I don't know why - even though I've always logically understood this - I always resisted it. But now it is clear. I did not choose where I was born. I did not choose my single mother or alcoholic dad. I did not pick my elementary school teachers - my entire childhood, I had virtually no say in what food I ate, activities I did, or friends I made. And I am forever grateful for all of it.

So many of the events that have shaped me, I did not choose - if any at all. How, then, can we claim our own agency? Because I am you, and you are me. Not everything happens for a reason, but reason makes everything happen. I is all. May this reality not slip my mind in the future. But when it does, may it peacefully reenter my mind, and everything is going to be okay.

I don't fear self-delusion, I fear being *ignorant* of my self-delusion. Self-subjectivity: To know yourself the worst.

To *think* you're self-aware, but de facto self-delusional. To be the only one blind to one's blindness.

Shutter Island-kind-of-a-thing.

## How I Lie To Myself

* I tell myself I have great self-confidence, yet I freeze up whenever I talk to beautiful women.
* I tell myself I want to improve, yet I often self-sabotage whenever I get close to change.
* I tell myself I'm conscious, yet I walk around in a continuous state of fight-or-flight.

To shine light on darkness, and name things for what they are, so they hopefully, may not. This is the cure.

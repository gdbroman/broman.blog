Look at babies.

They’re naturally the most curious things you’ve ever seen. Always grabbing stuff - licking them - playing games, and mimicking their adult surroundings.

For most, this curiosity lasts a couple of years before it dies a slow death in school and at work. Don’t ask stupid questions, reading is a chore, and so on and so forth.

The artists are a different case. They either never let this curiosity die, or later in life reawaken their inner child again.

What has made our species so successful is probably that we possess both abilities. To play it safe and take risks. To save food in order to survive the winter, but also walk over that hill over there - because there might be banana trees behind it!

To tread whole continents. cross the Atlantic and soon our galaxy. To voyage. This is humans at their best.

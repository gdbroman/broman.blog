We think we know what we think - until we try verbalizing.

It is through the act of articulation that we discover what we really think. By nailing down our thoughts, and examining them.

Knowledge is not belief. Knowledge must be transformed into belief - refined and embodied.

Writing allows this: To explore our thinking; share and thereby borrow other mind's perspectives.

Don't hoard knowledge - share it. Come to know what you believe. Because if you don't, someone else will.

Everyone I know are going to die. *I am going to die!!*

I was about five years old when that first hit me. Most have an existential crisis around the same age when they first fully realize the implications of living. But the crisis tends to be short-lived and long forgotten about in adulthood.

Some, however, reawaken this reality later in life as a tool. It has been used by the stoics in particular to achieve clarity in everyday life - as a filter for what truly matters. And some who fully internalize it, such as Steve Jobs, attribute it as the most important factor for their success in life:

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

Its effectiveness is derived from its equalizing role. As Jobs continues to note; it will all be forgotten one day:

> Almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
> 
> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
> 
> No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

You're going to die, and you can either let it inspire or depress you. But either way, it will happen. No matter how long technology will permit us to postpone it. Whether it's in the form of cancer or a supernova, the death reaper has an appointment for each and every one of us.

So what do you do about that? Voluntarily accept it! Embrace it. Let it be a reminder that you probably won't get another chance. There's no reason *not* to give this thing our very best.

Do we have anything better to do?

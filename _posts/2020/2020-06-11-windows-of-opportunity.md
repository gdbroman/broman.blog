Sometimes you just gotta say *"screw it, let's do it."*

In spite of fear.

Like plunging into an ice cold lake.

Or moving to another country.

Think too long and you’ll chicken out.

Certain things should not be thought of too much.

Seemingly illogical things.

Like running an ultra-marathon.

Or leaving your safe 9 to 5 for a risky business venture.

Because certain things we do, not because they’re easy and pleasurable.

But precisely because they are hard.

Opportunities are rare.

Until they are not.

But if you don’t have lots going on - which most people don't - you can’t be discriminating.

Treat opportunities as scarce and you’ll have abundance.

Treat them as abundant and you’ll be left with none.

Until you have options, you just gotta say yes and act on everything.

Fast, before it’s too late.

> For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.

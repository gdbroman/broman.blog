Certainty's seen as a virtue, and its opposite a sin.

We signal to other's that we know what we're doing and why.

But life is mysterious and uncertain by nature.

_Why are we here? What are we supposed to do?_

Let's stop putting on an act.

If we instead welcome uncertainty and learn to be comfortable with unknowing - uttering "I don't know" - we may discover what was previously inaccessible by ego.

Certainty only arises out of uncertainty, order only from chaos.

In order to discover, one must first wander.

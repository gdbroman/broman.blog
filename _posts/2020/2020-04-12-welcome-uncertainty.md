In today's world, certainty is seen as a virtue, and its opposite a sin.

At all cost we try to signal to other's that we know what we're doing and why we're doing it.

But this is not life.

Life is mysterious - uncertain - by nature.

_Why are we here? What are we supposed to do?_

No one really knows.

Let's stop putting on an act.

Because if we instead welcome uncertainty and learn to be comfortable with not knowing - with uttering the words "I don't know" - we may start discovering things previously inaccessible by ego.

Certainty can only arise out of uncertainty. Order only from chaos.

In order to discover, one must first wander.

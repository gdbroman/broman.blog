The artist says the purpose of art is art-  and the normal person considers that to be an end, not a means. 

What is art but capturing states of consciousness? I'd say each artwork is another swing at kicking our stagnant-ass brains into a new gear.

Art is telepathy - the sharing of consciousness. And upon consuming another state of mind, some part of our own has to die. That's not dysfunctional - it's the ultimate transformer!

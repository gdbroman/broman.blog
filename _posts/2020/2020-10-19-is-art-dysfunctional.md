Frida Kahlo and Thomas Edison settled down at a table at the local restaurant, awaiting the waitress.

**EDISON:** *Thank you for swinging by, but I have got to be frank with you. Whilst your paintings move me, I have always struggled to see, what's the purpose of it?*

**KAHLO:** *The purpose of art is art.*

**EDISON:** *What silliness! It's a means to an end - not an end in itself. Entertainment! And so on, and so forth.*

**KAHLO:** *What's this "end" you're talking about? Is capturing states of consciousness an end? I'd say each artwork is another swing at kicking our stagnant brains into a new gear. It's telepathy - the sharing of consciousness.*

**EDISON:** *What is it with you artists and pseudoscientific terms? Telepathy, ha! You sound like my worker Tesla. Tell me, what's that any good for?*

**KAHLO:** *Upon consuming another state of mind, some part of our own has to die - has it not?*

**EDISON:** *I reckon, in some way it has - in order to make space for it, that is. Nonetheless, a painting will never help me get across the country as a locomotive will. It is a dysfunctional form of innovation.*

**KAHLO:** *But you said it yourself! My paintings moved you. That's not dysfunctional - I consider it the ultimate mover.*

**WAITRESS:** *Hello. Would you like to order something to drink? Or perhaps, an appetizer?*

**EDISON:** *Yes, I wou-*

**KAHLO:** *A glass of red wine, thank you. But I doubt this gentleman would like anything. It won't get him across the country, after all!*

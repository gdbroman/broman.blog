So, what do you do? The first question everyone asks upon meeting someone new.

And depending on your answer, the person asking will either, suddenly become very interested, or never talk to you again.

Most cultures place tremendous value on occupation. And, being a participant in such culture, it can be easy to wrap one's whole identity up in one thing.

The problem is, putting all of your identity eggs in one basket - whether it's being a straight-A student, beautiful model or a strong weightlifter - is a very unstable foundation for your emotional life.

Because one day, that basket will no longer be there. Stolen. With all of your eggs in it. And you will be left having an identity crisis.

This is life. The only guarantee is that there are no guarantees. Tragedies happen. People get fired from jobs, students make mistakes and our bodies degenerate.

## Reducing Emotional Volatility

And so just like one strives to diversify an investment portfolio to reduce it's risk and volatility, it might thus be wise to do the same for your identity.

Instead of thinking of yourself in terms of "I work at X" or "I'm a Y", don't be afraid to spend more time doing things that you've always secretly liked, but refrained from in fear of judgment.

Maybe you're a boxer who've always wanted to try opera singing - or an accountant with a secret passion for poetry. The less your interests have in common, the better. Since it'll be harder to put you in a box.

Yeah, your co-workers will probably laugh behind your back. But they'll also secretly want to express their authentic selves just like you and be jealous of your courage for doing so.

People like to box other people in. To think in terms of: "people who do X also like to do Y but never Z", and so on. So when you break these patterns you start freeing yourself from the very powerful force of culture that can steer one's life decisions.

Initially you'll have to pay the price of a little bit of humiliation for being different. But eventually your surrounding will get used to your new, more three-dimensional you.

Eventually, it will no longer freak people out when you're a little weird - it'll just be who you are.

Diversify your identity and you shall become a freer individual.

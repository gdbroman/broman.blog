An arm, a leg - all other things - is loud, painful and violent, when we lose them.

Losing ourselves is silent.

Rediscovering one's self becomes a task by contrast. So we drown in the herd, perceiving selfhood too risky.

Becoming a copy in quiet desperation:

> He feels best, considers himself to be healthiest, can appear to others to be in the pink of condition, just when the illness is at its most critical.

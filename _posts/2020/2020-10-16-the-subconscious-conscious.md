Continous self-sabotage

It's what you see in others

From which you think you're exempt

But the unconscious handles

Feeling unworthy

Tripping yourself up

A human without shortcomings

Would be not

Rising what's lurking

For a life of our making

To shine light underground

That is the undertaking

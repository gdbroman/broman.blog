It can't be a coincidence that *expression* is the linguistical opposite of *depression*.

To be liked by many for a shell or loved for your core by a few.
To express or depress one's self.

These are the choices we have.

Everyone is capable of hiding, but to *be* - unapologetically - only you can do.

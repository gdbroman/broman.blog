It can't be a coincidence that *expression* is linguistically opposite to *depression*.

To be liked by many for a shell, or loved by a few for your core.
To express or depress one's self.

These are the choices we have.

Everyone is capable of hiding, but to *be* - unapologetically - only you can do.

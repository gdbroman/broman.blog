*You think it's about the reward, motherfucker?*

*Are you kidding me? I'm not.*

*You, me - we're all gonna die. Before you know it, you're six feet under without having realized who you are. A whole life mistaking water for the the bowl.*

*Haven't you understood anything?*

*You think I am the outcome? Fuck you. Keep that conditional happiness-shit in your pocket.*

Then I get angry for getting angry over such pity things outside of my control: *Haven't I understood anthing?*

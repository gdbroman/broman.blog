*You think it's about the reward, motherfucker?*

*Are you kidding me? I'm not.*

*You, me - we're all gonna die. Before you know it, you're six feet under without having realized who you are. A whole life mistaking water for the the bowl.*

*Haven't you understood anything?*

*You think I identify with the outcome? Keep that conditional happiness, attachment-shit in your pocket.*

Then I get angry for getting angry over such petty things outside of my control:

*Haven't I understood anthing?*

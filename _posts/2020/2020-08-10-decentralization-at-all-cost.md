You know the type: social outcast, libertarian nerd who believes blockchain will solve all our problems.

> If only we decentralize everything, we can happily live out our lives on our own terms!

The problem is, as much as you may want it to be true, **you’re not an island.**

This cypherpunk stereotype I’m describing is also often someone very introverted, which may explain the appeal decentralization has to him. A kind of rebellious reaction against not being able to partake as a node in the social network of regular people.

But only because _your_ node doesn’t utilize many connections, doesn’t mean we should get rid of the network idea altogether.

Human’s biggest achievements all rely on network effects on some level. And increasingly so.

Even “lone inventors” couldn’t get their work done if it weren’t for infrastructure made possible by thousands of other people.

Notice that I’m not making an argument against blockchain technology or libertarianism per se.

To be totally clear, I’m actually writing this critique with one foot in the libertarian/crypto-space myself. And from time to time, I come dangerously close to being that delusional freedom propagating stereotype I’m describing.

It’s just that some of its proponents undermine these philosophies by becoming ideological about it. 

Forgetting the very thing which makes decentralization so beautiful, namely the absence of absolutism.

The allowance of a middle ground to be reached through free market mechanisms.

Not to take unnecessary risk, but risk nonetheless.

To live, not merely survive.

The quickest way from despair is doing something dangerous. Or scary. As long as the brain interprets it as dangerous it does the trick, does it not?

Such as moving to another country or quitting a safe 9 to 5.

For something bigger.

Yearning, adventuring; living, transcending.

Safety implying unrealization.

And pondering scary undertakings, one always concludes the worst-case _better_ than the amygdala's stories.

We suffer only in imagination-kind-of-thing.

A calm mind has little to fear.

We live to live, not merely survive.

Not to take unnecessary risks, but risks nonetheless.

The quickest way from despair is doing something dangerous. Or scary. As long as the brain interprets it as dangerous it seems to do the trick, does it not?

Such as moving to another country or quitting a safe 9 to 5.

For something bigger.

Yearning, adventuring; living, transcending.

Safety implying unrealization.

And pondering scary undertakings one always concludes the worst-case _better_ than one's amygdala sets it out to be.

We suffer only in imagination-kind-of-thing.

A calm mind has little to fear.

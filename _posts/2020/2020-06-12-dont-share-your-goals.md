The problem with sharing your goals is twofold:

If you get praised, that’ll trigger the same reward mechanisms as actual achievement. This tricks your brain into thinking that your work is done and consequently you won’t try as hard. Finishing becomes harder.

Secondly; the naysayers. But, contrary to the supporters - depending on your style - these people at least have the potential to trigger you, to work even harder. Given you’re in the mood of proving people wrong.

But most will not be naysayers.

So I’d say, work in silence. And then let the results speak for themselves, or however that cliche goes.

The exception would be a special kind of friend who can hold you accountable. Who wants the best for you.

Not carelessly giving praise away only because you say you’re gonna do something.

**Everybody _says_ they want to do stuff.**

You need someone who isn’t so easily fooled.

A Tyler Durden who can call you out, if you will.

When you’re being soft, hypocritical, and not following through.

There's this scene in Fight Club when Durden threatens a kiosk worker to pursue his dream of becoming a veterinarian:

> I know who you are. I know where you live. I'm keeping your license, and I'm going to check on you, mister Raymond K. Hessel. In three months, and then six months, and then a year, and if you aren't back in school on your way to being a veterinarian, you will be dead...
> 
> <cite>Chuck Palahniuk, _Fight Club_</cite>

I'm not suggesting we should be this radical.

But a step in this direction, in terms of the people we surround ourselves with, I think is a good thing.

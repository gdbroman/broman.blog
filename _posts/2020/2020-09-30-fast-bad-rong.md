It's my new favorite motto - isn’t it neat?

Basically, don't think - just do.

Refining's important, but first you need a draft. 

Heck, *THIS* is a draft.

And make it suck: Paint an ugly painting, write an incoherent essay, shoot a boring movie.

Because transforming something bad into something good is 10x easier than producing something good from scratch.

Publish at 80%, when you're a little bit embarrassed. If you're not embarrassed, you're not producing often enough.

It's opposite to what we're taught in school, and it works. 

It really works.

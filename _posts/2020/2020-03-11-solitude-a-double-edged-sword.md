Whatever balance between eremite and socializer one ultimately chooses, it's important to be aware of its effects - good and bad. This essay is such an exploration.

> The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.
> 
> <cite>Nikola Tesla, _My Inventions_</cite>

That's inventor Nikola Tesla. An individual so inventive that you may choose to call him father of the modern world. Tesla was also known for being extremely reclusive; spending days upon days in his New York research laboratory: "Of all things, I liked books best."

But the majority does not share Tesla's romantic view on solitude. Instead, the collective considers it something which is to be avoided at all cost. That to be alone for any extended period of time is only something for the misfits of society to dabble with. Nothing any sane being would voluntarily inflict upon himself.

The origins of this common belief is easily understood. Humans are a social animal. Evolution has simply selected for conformity and sticking to the group. That is how we survived on the savanna, how societies are built and how our genes get to be passed on. Being social is undeniably beneficial for the human species.

But since the benefits of social interactions are more widely understood and accepted than those of solitude, we will not be exploring it furthermore here.

## Overcompliance: The Greatest Danger of Socializing

Contrary to what Adam Smith might have thought, that which is beneficial for the group is not necessarily optimal for the individual. Because, whilst socializing might keep our genes happy, it might also come at the expense of our individual happiness and meaning in life.

If we overindulge ourselves in social activities, not allowing ourselves much alone time, we run the risk of developing a so called false self. A persona shaped by our surroundings with the purpose of pleasing others. Becoming overcompliant.

And the longer we let this continue, the greater the fear of being left alone grows, which increases our compliancy even more. We get stuck in a negative reinforcing loop of conformity. The tragic result may be never cultivating a true and authentic self. Merely dying a mirror.

> The fear of finding oneself alone - that is what they suffer from - and so they don't find themselves at all.

## To Be Alone Is to Be Human

Being alone is an absolute necessity for creating something unique since it means carving your own path, not being influenced by other's preconceived notions, attitudes and values.

And as Donald Winnicott writes, creation can be a way of discovering one's true self; perhaps the only way...

> With games, and only with games, can the child or the adult create, and use their whole personalities, and the individual only discover his personality when he becomes a creator.
> 
> <cite>Donald Winnicott, Playing and Reality</cite>

But being alone is hard. Difficult and risky. As Johann Wolfgang von Goethe writes in _The Sorrows of Young Werther_: "There is nothing more dangerous than solitude". He who voluntarily inflicts isolation upon himself treads a fine line between self realization and insanity.

Because of this - humans being more naturally inclined to continuous socializing - one might claim that is the easier path to take, indeed more primal. Whilst longer periods of solitude - harder. A way of separating oneself from evolutionary instincts and therefore, one might argue, being more human.

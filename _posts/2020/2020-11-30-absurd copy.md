Once upon a time, on a tiny speck,

Monkeys became self-aware, and now they’re depressed.

So off they went, on a meaning quest,

For every big thing, larger than themselves.

And how they searched! But to no avail.

They had tried with values - grandiose and noble!

They had witnessed the absurd, and there was no going back.

Hopelessness! Despair! What were their options?

To continue as regular? As if nothing had happened?

Not with pure will - not even death.

Unavoiding and unseeable, absurdity prevailed.

Tell me, why hold reason to such high regard?

You agree a hammer’s a tool,

But reason - no - you’ve made it your god!

When it can’t even provide,

The most fundamental thing:

A meaningful life?

Time is brief, but we are not.

May I never mistake a hammer for God.

There are those who compete.

And those who don’t.

The fighters and the apathetics.

Troublemaking winners, and lazy losers.

Then there are those who don’t fight - but still succeed.

They don’t declare war - nor do they surrender.

They are the non-competitors.

The still and happy.

The ultimate winners.

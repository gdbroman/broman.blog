To go through primary-, high school or college and exclaim

> Phew! I'm never opening up a textbook ever again!

This is far too common.

Would we not prefer a society where the amount of mandatory facts and concepts to be learned were fewer - but the average thirst for knowledge higher?

Because there is a trade off. Sure, you can try to cram in as much material as possible Ã  la John Stuart Mill's childhood. But at what cost?

Curiosity, genius, creativity. These things cannot be forced. However they can be crushed. And the school system is doing a fine job of that already.

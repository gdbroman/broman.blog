Those who like to read, write and think, often find themselves fantasizing about removing the minutia of everyday life. To isolate oneself in a cabin in the woods and just think all day.

Convincing themselves that, _then_ they would get their best work done. The greatest insights when uninterrupted by the external.

But there are certain professions that are best done part-time.

Politician is one of them. And philosopher is certainly another.

Generally speaking, "thinking", should never be one's full-time occupation. You're otherwise guaranteed disconnect from reality.

Because the moment you become successful enough that you can afford to go full time as a "thinker" or "writer" you remove the very feedback loop that got you to there in the first place.

This was Nikola Tesla's main beef with academics. That they lacked what one might call "common sense"...

> The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.

Now, I recognize this is a slippery slope to snobbery. Modern academic research has its purposes too. But they're probably fewer than we think.

Only because you can parrot - or ehm, excuse me, "reference" - another 100 researches that have all previously said the same thing, doesn't make your thesis less disconnected from reality.

Something's not true merely because you repeat it multiple times. So let's not rely on these people to figure out how live and die well. But I digress.

The main problem with becoming a full-time philosopher can be summed up by the following quote by Ryan Holiday:

> Philosophy was never what happened in the classroom it was a set of lessons from the battlefield of life.

Somethings very wrong when...

* the average person can no longer see any practical use in reading Plato or Seneca
* the average philosophy professor is uninterested in self-improvement and living an examined life
* not a single employer outside of academia, voluntarily hires a philosophy researcher

These are some serious failures on part of the universities.

> Philosophy is busted, it's at an end, it's broken, and the reason is that the universities have seized this subject and they have made it in to the most boring subject on Earth.
> 
> Philosophy used to be the place you would look at...to answer the biggest questions: "What are we here for?", "What do we do about suffering?", "How can we understand love?", "What about sex?", "What about beauty... money?" All these things used to be philosophical questions. This subject which was a beautiful guiding light, has been killed by academics.

## Practice Beats Theory

> In theory, theory and practice are the same.
> 
> In practice, they are not.
> 
> <cite>Benjamin Brewster</cite>

Never delude yourself into thinking that you're too good for living and studying the everyday life.

This is why the greatest scientists and philosophers throughout history never considered theorizing to be their full time occupation.

* Nikola Tesla was primarily an inventor; science and philosophy was his sidekick
* Ditto for Benjamin Franklin
* Marcus Aurelius was a roman emperor, his philosophical discoveries came not from sitting still, thinking - but from doing

As Nassim Nicholas Taleb have pointed out, most "academic" discoveries were in fact made by practicioners:

> The odds of an academic “researcher” producing anything eventually used by society is of the order of .00001%. That includes scientists.
>
> The odds for a baker: 100%

Plato would have been horrified if he saw that today, being a politician is considered a full time occupation. He famously once said that the world wouldn't become right...

> until political power and philosophy entirely coincide, while the many natures who at present pursue either one exclusively are forcibly prevented from doing so, cities will have no rest from evils,... nor, I think, will the human race

And later Nicholas Taleb added that...

> To become a successful philosopher king it is much better to start as a king than as a philosopher

Theory must arise out of practice. Not the other way around.

## Discomfort the Greatest Teacher

Because life's deepest truths are not found up in the ivory tower. They're discovered through hardships.

To paraphrase ultra-endurance athlete David Goggins: listen to the guy who immersed himself in hell and found a way to get through it, not the theoretician...

> You can’t read somebody else’s book about some theory on how to do shit, some guy who sat up in their nice warm office and wrote some book with a nice cup of coffee in the fucking hand, no.
> 
> I wanna see that guy who immersed himself in fucking hell… and found out a way to get through it
> 
> <cite>David Goggins</cite>

Since our brains are genial at tricking us, pain, struggle and suffering are essentials for discovering the truth.  

We're masters at deluding ourselves and ignoring uncomfortable truths in the pursuit of conserving energy. Some truths, therefore, are only accessible through hardships.

Going to war - figuratively or literally - building a business, running a country, inventing technology or being a parent.

These, what one might call near-life experiences, are what unravels life's deepest mysteries.

Life without art is tragic, but art without life is none.

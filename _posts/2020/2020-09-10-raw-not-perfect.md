Perfection being the enemy is such a clich√©.

But no matter how many times we hear it, I think everybody has to go through their own unique journey of internalization. Battling the *"resistance"*, as Steven Pressfield calls it, is a mandatory process for every creator.

And it's not a matter of winning or losing. You never *defeat* resistance. You notice it - *feel* it - then show up anyway. Partly, I think, because one realizes that our highest selves reside in a place of authenticity.

Being human is rough, and rawness allows us to connect. Perfection is about removing flaws; art is about opening up.

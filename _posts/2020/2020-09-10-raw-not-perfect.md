Perfection being the enemy is such a clich√©.

But no matter how many times we hear it, I think everybody has to go through their own unique journey of internalization. Battling *"the resistance"*, as Steven Pressfield calls it, is mandatory for every creator.

It's not a matter of winning or losing. You never *defeat* resistance, nor does it ever disappear.

You notice the resistance - *feel* it - then show up anyway.

Partly, I think, because one realizes that our highest selves reside in a place of authenticity.

Being human is rough. Our communication has to match that.

Perfection's about removing flaws but art is about opening up.

Perfection prohibits expression.

Rawness allows us to connect.

I can't take people who take themselves seriously, seriously.

Including myself: Being serious is my default state, and I hate it.

Comedians are geniuses.

Society got it all wrong: It's the "egomaniacs" that are selfless.

Those we call humble and egoless are simply hiding behind culturally acceptable behaviour, but they're gods in their own minds. Shyness is nothing short of egoism and passive self-obsession: A fear of punctuating one's own fantasy.

It's the egomaniacs that have given up on worrying about other's perceptions of them. Learned to turn their focus outwards, when the situation calls for it.

To be unapologetically open and risk one's self-image, in order to potentially contribute: This is the way of egolessness if there ever was one.

The larger the company the less innovative and agile. The bigger the country, the more corrupt and thinner the safety net. These are not proposed laws, simply observations.

As Nassim Nicholas Taleb has pointed out, scaling reduces skin in the game, unless the organization is split up into smaller pieces.

Like the US with somewhat independent states or Google and its differentiated projects. But this is not sufficient since you can still have subdepartments in an organization without any skin in the game. Such as administrators in a municipality that create a budget for money they’re simply handed by the state. Such a situation is guaranteed to corrupt.

Not because administrators are evil, but because they do not have any skin in the game. They never suffer consequences from wrongdoing.

As Milton Friedman stipulated, there are four ways to spend money. Here they are listed by decreasing feedback responsiveness:

1. You can spend your own money on yourself
2. You can spend your own money on somebody else
3. You can spend somebody else’s money on yourself
4. You can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else

At (1) you’re both concerned about the cost (since it’s your money) and about the content of what you’re buying (since it’s for you - and you obviously want what’s best for you).

But at (4) you’re neither concerned about the cost nor the content. Since you’re not using your own money, nor is that which you're buying intended for you.

This is probably why we’ve never seen a well functioning welfare state last with a population over 10 million people. The feedback loop is simply lost. Things get too abstracted. So what’s the solution?

It seems like there are two alternatives: If you seek safety; never let anything get too big or powerful. Keep everything small and nicely knit together. You can have your small welfare state or innovative startup. But if you seek freedom you should be more sceptical about organizations as a whole.

Many who fear man-made existential threats, such as climate change and nuclear war, suggest globalization as the solution. That we have to get everybody on the same page and tackle our problems together as a species.

It’s a beautiful thought. Nevertheless naive. Because let’s be real: We can’t even properly run countries that are less than 1/10th of the world population. How on earth do we plan on running earth?

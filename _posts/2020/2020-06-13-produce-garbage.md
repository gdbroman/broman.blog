We’ve all heard it.

“Done is better than perfect”.

And “real artists ship”.

Everyone knows that focusing on quantity is the best way of learning.

Through rapid trial and error.

That just hitting “publish” or showing our work to the world will teach us 10x the amount of sitting and philosophizing.

Yet it’s so hard to swing one into the trees.

To not identify with the quality of your work.

Once again, ego is the enemy.

Take these blog posts for example.

9/10 of my posts are straight up ramblings.

I’m just transcribing my stream of consciousness. And even though I know that’s their purpose, it’s a challenge every single time. To not give into the resistance. "It's not good enough", etc.

But then every once in a while I produce something decent. Something I can be proud of to say “I did that”.

**The point is, you can’t choose when that gem will show up.**

Producing the garbage following up to the good work is necessary in terms of the learning it provides.

You’ll just have to continue to produce garbage and trust the process.

To keep showing up.

Eventually - and hopefully with increasing frequency - you'll hit a hole-in-one.

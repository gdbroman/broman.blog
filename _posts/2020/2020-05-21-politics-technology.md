What is politics? Let's say: A set of questions which the average person can’t easily be persuaded into changing his mind about.

If you accept this definition, statements such as _“politics is overrated”_ and _“the modern world did not come about because of politics”_ (both of which I’ve been guilty of uttering myself) become rather ridiculous.

It is in the same category of lazy thinking as: “if it wasn’t for religion, we would have permanent world peace by now”.

And it’s not that these statements are necessarily _false_. They’re just not very helpful. **They’re basically saying “if it wasn’t for HUMANS, we wouldn’t have any problems”.**

Yeah. Thing is: humans are pretty neat and we are not disappearing any time soon. Maybe that’ll change when we invent artificial general intelligence and become obsolete. But in the meantime, we’re just gonna have to accept the facts:

* That humans are irrational. Especially those who delude themselves into thinking that they’re not.
* That humans are emotional and ideological. We start wars over insults and shiny objects.
* That Humans dislike change. Especially regarding their own beliefs, opinions and meta-beliefs (like, that they’re even ideological to begin with).

The best we can do is try to raise our self-awareness. That for the most part, we’re all just stupid monkeys trying to do our best about this whole “waking up on a floating rock”-thing.

So take a deep breath and say it with me: _“I’m a clueless ape who doesn't know what’s going on, and that’s okay”._

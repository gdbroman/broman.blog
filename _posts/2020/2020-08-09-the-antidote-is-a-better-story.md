Storytelling is the only skill there is.

Making money and building companies is storytelling.

Every kind of art - and politics - is *definitely* storytelling.

Even science and technology. Yes, really; stories about reality.

As long as you’re in the materialistic paradigm, it’s all stories.

So whenever there’s friction or stagnation don't give up on storytelling altogether - seek a better story! You can decide what stories to subscribe to.

And at any moment, if the present stories don't cut it, you can become a storyteller.

What stories will you tell?

Have meditated a lot in the last few days, and I think it's finally starting to click. Or at least, this: *Becoming who you are is about removing what you are not.*

Unpacking baggage you've accumulated over the years; opinions, beliefs, stories, etc.

Unknotting knots, unwiring loops, emptying the cup. Resetting the default setting.

Stripping away all your clever little ideas and concepts.

Including your self.

Have been doing a lot of meditation in the last few days. I think it's finally starting to click. Or at least, this: *Becoming who you are is about removing what you are not.*

Unpacking all that baggage you've accumulated over the years; opinions, beliefs and stories.

Unknotting knots, unwiring loops, emptying the cup. Resetting the default setting.

Stripping away all your clever little ideas and concepts.

Including your self.

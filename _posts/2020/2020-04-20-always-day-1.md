The moment we start building a persona around our previous successes is the moment we start relaxing: When we stop watching our step, trip and fall.

An age characterized by branding and internet presence is a very dangerous such. Because whilst full of opportunities, there's also a fatal risk.

There's the trap of getting enough positive feedback from your marketed persona that you stop improving on the features that got you there in the first place.

This might present itself as harsh. But I also think it's true. In life there are no breaks. It's always going, never a time for kicking back.

And there are only two options: Either you are pointing _up_ or _down_ - no in between. Things deteriorate with time. That's entropy. You've never seen a house _not_ taken care of get better with time.

The only way to improvement is humility. Don't say _"I know how that works"_. Ask _"how does it work?"_ Never think you're somehow better or wiser than others. Ask what they might know that you don't.

Now you're pointing up.

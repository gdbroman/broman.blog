When an idea at first arises from the subconscious, one is first struck by an overwhelming feeling of euphoria. Whether it be a book, software program, business or painting, we become immensely motivated by its potential: Of what we could create.

But then another, less pleasant feeling of doubt introduces itself. Could we really do this? Am I capable of such an achievement? And we get anxious over all the work it would actually take to realize our idea.

Sadly, this is were the process ends for most. The overwhelming self-doubt suffocates the initial motivation.

## The Emotionally Paradoxical Nature of Creatives

But contrary to popular belief, it's not that successful creatives don't doubt or feel fear. As psychologist Rollo May writes in his classic Courage to Create,

> Courage is not the absence of despair; it is, rather, the capacity to move ahead in spite of despair.

Take for example the following quote by Søren Kierkegaard in which he describes the close interlink between creativity and anxiety:

> To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose one's self... And to venture in the highest is precisely to be conscious of one's self.

In other words, creativity and courage are intimately linked. To move on in spite of fear because the task's importance overrides it; that is what it means to be courageous. And it is an absolute necessity in order to create something unique since it will always involve an element of uncertainty and risk.

This presents a somewhat paradoxical emotional nature of creatives. As Rollo May continues...

> A curious paradox characteristic of every kind of courage here confronts us. It is the seeming contradiction that we must be fully committed, but we must also be aware at the same time that we might possibly be wrong.

## To Create is to Be Courageous

This reality, being opposite to common belief, is also analogous to a key difference between Stoicism and Epicureanism. As Seneca writes in his classic Letters from a Stoic:

> The difference here between the Epicurean and our own [Stoic] school is this: our wise man feels his troubles but overcomes them, while their wise man does not even feel them.

This key difference presents a far more optimistic view on creativity: Instead of viewing the act of creating as something only reserved for the Übermensch who never feel fear, it is something accessible for far more people: Those who are simply willing to take on the inevitable suffering that accompanies creation.

To create is to be courageous. It's to embark on a journey full of uncertainty, doubt and anxiety. But it is also a journey to ultimate meaning in life.

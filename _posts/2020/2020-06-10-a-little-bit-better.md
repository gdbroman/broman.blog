The boiling frog who does not realize its impending death.

The 1940 Germans who wouldn’t speak up to any incremental and seemingly arbitrary change.

The miserable couch potato who won’t see his life’s running away.

A calm mind, financial independence and physical health.

**Big things - good or bad - seldom happen all at once.**

They’re the result of a thousand small changes.

Compounding.

How can we use this wisdom in our daily lives?

Without it, you’ll be unaware.

Of the person you’re slowly turning into.

But initiated, we may ask:

Am I doing _one thing_ a little bit better today?

This is our compass.

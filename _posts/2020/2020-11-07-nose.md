You're fucked - and I don't mean it in a derogatory way.

You know how your brain automatically ignores your nose if you don't consciously focus on it, but you can see everyone else's perfectly clear?

It's so obvious how your neighbour's got character flaws. It's obvious how your mom self-sabotages, and you could destroy your friend in a sentence.

Everyone has demons, *but why is it so god damn hard to see our own?* We think we see them - but how could you know for sure? That you're not blind to blindness like every other fool?

The rent for an examined life is always due.

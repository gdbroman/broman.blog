You're fucked - and I don't mean that in a derogatory way.

You know how your brain automatically ignores your nose if you don't consciously focus on it, but you can see everyone else's perfectly clear?

It's real easy seeing how humans are fucked. It's so obvious how your neighbour got character flaws. It's obvious how your mom self-sabotages - and you could destroy your friend in one sentence.

Everyone got demons, *but why is it so god damn hard to see our own?* Like, I think I *kind of* see them - but how could you know? That you're not blind to blindness like every other fool?

The examined life got its rent due every single day.

You're fucked - and I don't mean it in a derogatory way.

You know how your brain automatically ignores your nose if you don't consciously focus on it, but you can see everyone else's perfectly clear?

It's so obvious how your neighbors got character flaws. It's obvious how your mom self-sabotages, and you could destroy your friend in a sentence.

Everyone has demons, *but why is it so goddamn hard to see our own?* We think we see them - but how could you know? That you're not blind to blindness like every other self-deluded fool?

The rent for an examined life is always due.

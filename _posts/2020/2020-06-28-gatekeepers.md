The recruiter at the job interview, investors, the panel at the acting audition, and college admissions. Gatekeepers can be found everywhere.

What to do about this?

A first step could be to proactively reframe the situation so that you don’t fall victim.

Your future does not lie in the gatekeeper's hands.

**It’s your job to sell.**

Whether it’s selling yourself to the recruiter or your idea to the investor.

You are in control.

Really etch that into your brain.

Step two is to always have a backup plan.

That way you won’t become desperate.

This is essential.

Gatekeepers can smell desperation from a mile away and it makes them shut that gate quicker than anything else.

Understandably so. Who wants to be around someone with a scarce mindset?

Paradoxically, the less you care about a certain gatekeeper's decision, the more likely it’ll be successful.

Gatekeepers love to exercise power. And by communicating an abundance of opportunity you take that power away from them.

Consequently, the gatekeeper can’t help but to let you in.

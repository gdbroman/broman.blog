Soul, demons, spirits and God. Some situations require that kind of language and if you don’t agree, I’d say you’ve probably never had an experience at either tail of the distribution. Neither horrific nor transcendental.

I’m sick of these "rationalists" and self-proclaimed atheists who think they’re somehow special because they don’t literally believe what's in the Bible, say. They're making the same mistake as the fundamentalists who _do_ believe in a literal sense.

Religious language was never intended to be used literally. It offers something secular language can’t. The Bible for example, contains undeniable gems if read as a metaphorical work.

You don’t need to be _religious_ (whatever that means) to extract useful lessons from religion. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb (somewhat) eloquently lays out in Skin in the Game (he’s somewhat of a rambler):

> The only definition of rationality that makes sense, is behavior that increases your chances of survival.

So it does not matter why you’re an obedient citizen - as long as it keeps you a seat at the tribe’s table of preserving the species, we’ve got a deal.

Because talk is cheap. We’ve all went to the kitchen, opened the fridge and stood there like an idiot because we can’t remember our errand.

It makes you think: _How much of our reasoning for doing stuff is simply rationalising, after the fact?_ God only knows why we do the things we do.

Didn’t Yuval Noah Harari already make it crystal clear how our entire lives rely on fictional stories? And how it’s not necessarily a bad thing!? [1]

Money, nations, companies and culture. These are useful, and therefore rational, beliefs.

So show me an atheist who acts without belief. I’ll wait.

## Footnotes

[1] Ironically, many people who actually praised _Sapiens_ for it’s analysis of human belief were - you guessed it - atheists.

Human's problem is not of knowing, but of action.

What if, tomorrow morning, you did everything *knowing* to be of goodness and importance, whilst avoiding the counter?

How would such a humiliatingly simple - indeed laughable! promise - if kept, affect one's life and humanity?

Why don't we? Why the Ãœbermensch an unrealizable ideal? Can we not fight as individuals?

Fighting is to no effect. Humanity has made a vow with mediocrity, and homeostasis its friend.

Transcendence seems our only option.

To see where you're at, and how far it is from where you want to be.

It's not about the size of the gap: What's your everyday relationship with it?

Does it hurt? It means you've got taste. But does it also inspire you to keep working?

Really; I think a bittersweet relationship is what you want.

Appreciating the gap provides an aim. 

And pain? The fuel.

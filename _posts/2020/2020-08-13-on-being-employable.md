What is it? And why does it sometimes feel so detrimental to the soul and orthogonal to being human?

Well how couldn’t it? Putting on a fake smile for the interview, talking about your love for this and that void-of-meaning corporate buzzword. Claiming a natural inclination for teamwork and office socializing, even though both you and the interviewer know you’re an eremite wanting to be left alone if there ever was one. 

You sitting there with a bright flickering LED lamp in your face thinking, _is this what we’re supposed to? Is this humanity at its peak: Sitting inside rectangular shaped cement blocks during the day’s most precious hours?_ You don’t say that of course - or that would be _“unprofessional”_. Instead you go on about how you, as an [insert bullshit corporate title here] _love_ what you do (even though you never use that word even for your family members), how you’re always on time and do not shy away from working hard (sort of implicitly communicating that you indeed will do as you’re told and be an office slave from nine to five every weekday and maybe even on the weekends).

And then when you’re employed; returning home at noon with 90% of your mental energy already used up, using those 10% that’s left to microwave some processed food and mindlessly consume social media news feeds, slowly lowering your consciousness until your thoughts are down to “hungry - more snacks” and “feeling tired - one more Netflix”. Then waking up the next morning to once again squeeze yourself together amongst hundreds of other stressed workers on their way to rectangular cement blocks.

Dystopian? A bit, I’ll admit. It’s definitely not _professional_ to point this out anyways. In fact, if a recruiter were to see this, I’d probably be removed from that company’s hiring list. 

What being employable really means can be thought of as a sort of artificial humanism. The perfect employee is what you’d get if you instructed a robot, incapable of having negative emotions, to act humanly but then only displaying happiness, good will and enterprise. It's really quite simple: If you feel sad, stuff it in and only let it out if no one can see you. Some emotions are even better if you yourself don’t even acknowledge: _Finding your work soul-destroyingly boring? Of course you aren’t!_

And thanks to the publicity of the internet, you have to keep your “employability ranking” in mind even when you're on platforms that are supposedly not work-related such as Facebook and Instagram, since _anything you say on the internet may be used against you in the court of hiring._ Everything you post can be found with a quick Google search - and the recruiter _will_ Google search, mind you - so you better stay professional.

Whatya do? Whatya working on?

A meaningful life demands passionate activity.

But to be idle for shorter periods of time, is essential for mental health and creativity.

To take walks without purpose - without a phone or podcast neurotically playing at 2x speed in your ears.

To sit quietly in a room.

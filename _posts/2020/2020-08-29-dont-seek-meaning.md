*"What's the meaning of life?"* is a meaningless question.

It's not the *wrong* question. It's the very act of questioning that is mistaken. The egoic mind playing games. Tricks!

The question only arises in moments lacking meaningful *experience*. You never ask "why" when you're in the middle of a flow experience.

> People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. **I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive**

> <cite>Joseph Campbell</cite>

> Sometimes, you think you have to figure out your life’s purpose, but you really just need some macadamia nuts and a cold fucking shower.

Chop wood, carry water.

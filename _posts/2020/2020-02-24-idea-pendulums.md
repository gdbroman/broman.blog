Oh look! A new thing! Finally there's a new thing. Let's look at the new thing! A new thing - how fascinating!

*Time passes*

Wait a minute. There's this other thing over here which is the opposite of the previous thing.

*Metaphorically walks over and inspects the new new thing*

Wow! Incredible! I can't believe how stupid I was before when I preferred the old new thing over the new new thing. But now it's so obvious! The new new thing is way better.

*More time passes*

You know what? Back when I wasn't fully informed of the landscape, the novelty of the new new thing might have blinded me from seeing the bigger picture. But now that I've been on both sides I think I might have underestimated the old new thing.

*Metaphorically walks back to the old new thing*

And on it goes, back and forth.

When we're exploring a new landscape - be it diets, politics or life philosophies - we tend to cling on to the idea that first happens to catch our eye. The idea's novelty is enough to convince us of its validity.

But as we become more well versed - as we get to know the landscape's different valleys and mountaintops - we gradually realize that the idea we initially clinged on to isn't terribly unique.

And so we embark on a new journey towards a seemingly more valid goal. A higher peak, a more difficult valley - a more sophisticated idea. And my god, is it promising! Even better than last time - we naively think to ourselves.

But then more time passes and a frightening thought hits us: Is it possible that our preference for this idea is just as loosely based as it was the first time around? A mere novelty effect all over again? Yes. You realize that it is.

The result is that you adopt a kind of relativistic viewpoint. You see one person preach X and another preach Y, and silently remark to yourself how naive they are since you recognize your previous self in them. You've realized that X and Y are both points on the same MÃ¶bius strip!

You are wiser now. Right or wrong, better or worse, true or false. It is all perspective. There is no such thing as objective truth! Until there is.

Until, one of the ideas reintroduce themselves in your mind as more presentable - be it X or Y, it doesn't matter (because you know where this is going). And this time it's different. This time your preference will be objective. Based in reality.

And just like that, you've closed the loop. Forever stuck in an eternal cycle, riding the pendulum of ideas. But each time you finish and come full circle, you end up a little bit wiser. Then something peculiar happens: You start recognizing where other people are in their loops.

And lastly you notice something unfortunate. That most haven't even completed a single loop. That they're still stuck at X or Y.

This can only mean one thing: A loop yet to be discovered.

Oh look! X! Finally there's a new thing. Let's look at the new thing! X - how fascinating!

*Time passes*

Wait a minute. There's this Y over there which is the opposite of X.

*Metaphorically walks over and inspects Y*

Wow! This is incredible! I can't believe how stupid I was before when I preferred X over Y. But now it's obvious! Y is way better.

*More time passes*

You know what? Back when I wasn't fully informed of the landscape, the novelty of Y might have blinded me from seeing the bigger picture. But now that I've been on both sides I think I might have underestimated X.

*Metaphorically walks back to X*

And on it goes...Back and forth.

When we're exploring a new landscape - be it diets, politics or life philosophies - we tend to cling on to the idea that first happens to catch our eye. The idea's novelty is enough to convince us of its validity.

But as we become more well versed - as we explore the landscape's different valleys and mountaintops - we gradually realize that the idea we initially clinged on to isn't terribly unique. In fact it's probably worse than most.

And so we embark on a new journey towards a seemingly more valid goal. A higher peak, a more difficult valley - a more sophisticated idea. And my god, is it promising! It's even better than last time, we naively think to ourselves.

But then more time passes and a frightening thought hits us: Is it possible that our preference for this idea is just as loosely based as it was the first time around? A mere novelty effect all over again? Yes. You realize that it is.

The result is that you adopt a kind of relativistic viewpoint. You see one person preach X and another preach Y, and silently remark to yourself how naive they are since you recognize your previous self in them. You've realized that X and Y are both points on the same one-sided MÃ¶bius strip!

You are wiser now. Right or wrong. Better or worse. True or false. It's all just perspective. There's no such thing as objective truth!

Until there is.

Until, one of the ideas reintroduce themselves in your mind as more presentable - be it X or Y, it doesn't matter (because you know where this is going). And this time it's different. This time your preference will be objective. Based in reality.

And just like that, you've closed the loop. Forever stuck in an eternal cycle, riding the pendulum of ideas. But each time you finish and come full circle, you end up a little bit wiser. Then something peculiar happens: You start recognizing where other people are in their loops.

And lastly you notice something unfortunate. That most haven't even completed a single loop. That they're still stuck at X or Y.

This can only mean one thing. That there's an even higher meta level to this game. A loop yet to be discovered.

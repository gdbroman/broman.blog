The scientist seeks perfect understanding but does not bother with execution.

The engineer seeks perfect execution but does not bother with understanding.

**The hacker's only goal is to *make it work.* Understanding and refining comes later.**

Thusly, the hacker gets more done than the engineer and the engineer more than the scientist.

## If You Want to Get Shit Done, Hire a Hacker, Not a Scientist

Though originating from the computer programming world, the concept of a "hacker" is more of a mindset we can all adapt.

A mindset that voluntarily accepts chaos with the understanding that it's ultimately the only way to order.

An understanding that perfection is the creator's worst enemy. That done is better than perfect. That *"does it work?"* is enough of a criteria.

An internalization that one is always greater than zero. That a thousand mediocre clay pots is better than one finished only in theory.

That doing is the most efficient way of learning. That practice beats theory.

So if you want to feel smart in fairy tale land, by all means, become a scientist. But if you later on want to get shit done, you'll have to hire a hacker.

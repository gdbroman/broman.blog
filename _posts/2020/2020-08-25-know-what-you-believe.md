We think we know what we think - until we try to articulate it.

But it is through the act of articulation that we can *discover* what we really think. To nail our thoughts down and examine them.

Knowledge is not belief; knowledge must be *transformed* into belief. Refined and embodied. It's not a belief until it's a part of who we are and how we act.

Writing allows this. It let's us explore and refine our thinking. To share and thereby borrow other mind's perspectives.

**Don't hoard knowledge; share it.** Come to know what you believe.

Because if you don't, someone else will.

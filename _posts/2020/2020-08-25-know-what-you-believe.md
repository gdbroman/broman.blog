We *think* we know what we think - until we try to articulate it.

But it is through the act of articulation that we discover what we think. By nailing our thoughts down and examining them.

Knowledge is not belief; knowledge must be transformed into belief. Refined and embodied.

Writing allows this: To explore our thinking; share and thereby borrow other mind's perspectives.

**Don't hoard knowledge - share it.**

Come to know what you believe.

Because if you don't, someone else will.

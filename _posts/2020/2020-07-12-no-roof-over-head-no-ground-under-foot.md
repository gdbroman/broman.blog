It is perhaps one of life’s most valuable skills: The ability to be comfortable with uncertainty.

Being comfortable not knowing what’s gonna happen, and not having all the answers. That dreamlike feeling of, *the world doesn’t have to make sense.*

To go through periods of feeling really naked and unsure.

In Zen they call it _“no roof over head, no ground under foot”_.

Because clarity's prerequisite is confusion. The greatest insights come from equally great ignorance.

But you gotta be willing to discard your own beliefs. In order to get strong, you first need the humility of being weak.

Freedom is not free and the price for comfort is discomfort.

It’s the ultimate marshmallow test: Either be safe now and face uncertainty later. Or, embrace uncertainty for a more promising future.

Either way, uncertainty is coming for all of us.

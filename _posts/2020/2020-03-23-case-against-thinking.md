Sometimes, thinking isn't the answer.

The lower the state of consciousness, the higher the need to think. The higher the seeming necessity of "figuring things out". Whereas when your state is uplifted - when your biochemistry on point - no problem seems too big to solve. No hurdle to big to overcome. Everything's already perfect.

Sounds like woo-woo? You've probably experienced it yourself. Think about the last time you finished a 60 minute jog. Or when you plunged into an ice cold lake during winter. You're on top of the world. You can't even remember why you were worried.

It's why cold showers are so effective. They shut off your thinking brain. When you are under that merciless shower head for 30 seconds - or for however long you push yourself - there's no thinking about what you'll eat for dinner, how you'll write that work email or your professional future. No. It's just you and that cold fucking shower

So the next time you feel stressed or just can't seem to think of a solution to something - don't think harder. That'll just worsen it. Instead; go for a run, take a cold shower, hit the sauna or do some push ups.

Raise your state and your problems will cease.

I think it's finally starting to click. Or, shall I say un-click? *Becoming who you are is about removing what you are not.*

Unpacking baggage you've accumulated over the years; opinions, beliefs, stories, etc. Unknotting knots, unwiring loops, emptying the cup. Resetting the default setting.

Stripping away all your clever little ideas and concepts. Including your self.

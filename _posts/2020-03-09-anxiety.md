How should you live your life? Being adventurous and saying yes to every opportunity? Or: Being structured, holding your own schedule dear. Should you strive for chaos or order?

Humans have an evolutionary bias for order. We see this very clearly in today's society where in which we try to find a quick fix for every negative feeling:

Feeling stressed? Try this meditation app! Depressed? Take these pills. Bored? No worries - here's a thousand cat videos!

But may it be, that we are missing out on some valuable lessons by always trying to experience positive emotions? That we are forgetting the importance of anxiety?

With some variance between personalities, we're naturally risk averse creatures, trying to rid our lives of events and responsibilities which cause us anxiety. Or as Carl Jung put it:

> [we] have a mighty dislike of all intentional effort and are addicted to absolute laziness until circumstances prod [us] into action.

We've learned to conform, since "the nail that sticks out shall be hammered down”.

But we should not underestimate the power of chaos' role in living a meaningful life. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote...

> One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.

Because when you live comfortably, nothing interesting ever happens. A orderly life is also a boring one. Admittedly, living fully in chaos is no good either, since you'll constantly feel too overwhelmed to get anything done.

The answer thus seems to be found in the middle as is suggested by the ancient Chinese symbol Yin and Yang.

By letting in some chaos into our lives in the form of more action and responsibilities, it also inevitably means higher levels of stress and anxiety.

There's no way around this.

But we can choose to embrace this reality. And by so doing, attacking life head on and experiencing a deeper sense of meaning few ever will.

I"§<p>Balance: Is it a lie?</p>

<p>Oneâ€™s time and mental energy - whilst more abundant than most probably think - is, undeniably limited.</p>

<p>Each day youâ€™re handed a certain amount of fuel units and itâ€™s your job to spend them wisely with respect to your short- and long term goals.</p>

<p>Once again, you can increase those fuel units through lifestyle design. But no matter how much meditating and fasted exercise you do, thereâ€™ll always be 24 hours in a day.</p>

<p>Everybody gets 24 hours.</p>

<p>So whatâ€™s your strategy? Balance or focus?</p>

<p>Because you only get to have one - or maybe two - spikes. Each hour you spend on activity X could be an hour spent on activity Y.</p>

<p>Ideally you choose your spikes synergistically. Such as how physical exercise empowers you to get more done in your career or business.</p>

<p>But other times youâ€™ll have to let something go. It may be a hobby very dear to your heart, but you recognize that it is taking away resources that you could spend on getting to your ultimate goal.</p>

<p>So if you seek balance, lifeâ€™s a juggling act.</p>

<p>But if you seek focused progress, lifeâ€™s a narrow road of sacrifices.</p>

I"Â<p>Maybe you seek to become more compassionate.</p>

<p>To take better care of yourself.</p>

<p>Or, to find a greater purpose?</p>

<p>Weâ€™re all on our own unique journey.</p>

<p>Though some are more conscious of it than others.</p>

<p>And if youâ€™ve ever left home for an extended period of time, you know that an external journey can aid the internal one.</p>

<p>How - upon returning - you view everything with a fresh pair of eyes.</p>

<p>Noticing new opportunities, and how previous seemingly insurmountable problems are no longer.</p>

<p>You know what to do and how.</p>

<p>Everythingâ€™s clear and your mind more open.</p>

<p>Stay in the same place for too long and you get stuck in a rut.</p>

<p>Some of this wisdom lives on in our modern culture - but on a very low level.</p>

<p>We know that weâ€™re supposed to travel - but why?</p>

<p>Do we know?</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s relaxing - or something like that.</p>

<p>To be totally honest, we mostly do it because everyone else does.</p>

<p>Once a year we partake in the standard routine of lying down on a beach at a fancy hotel. And why complain? Itâ€™s pleasurable!</p>

<p>Well, these kinds of vacations seldom leave a mark on us.</p>

<p>They tend to melt together into one foggy pot of sandy feet and margaritas.</p>

<p>Once again, weâ€™re reminded that pleasure is not a satisfactory goal.</p>

<p>Travel can be so much more than that.</p>

<p>A challenging hike through the mountains might make you realize how beautifully meaningful life is.</p>

<p>A month of sailing alone could bring you closer to your friends and family.</p>

<p>And a solo retreat into the woods might make you religious.</p>

<p>Travel and you shall progress.</p>

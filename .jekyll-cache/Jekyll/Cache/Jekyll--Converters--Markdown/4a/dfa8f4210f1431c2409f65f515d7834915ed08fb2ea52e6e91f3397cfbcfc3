I"£<p>It‚Äôs perhaps one of life‚Äôs most valuable skills: The ability to be comfortable with uncertainty.</p>

<p>Being comfortable not knowing what‚Äôs gonna happen and not having all the answers.</p>

<p>That feeling of: the world doesn‚Äôt have to make sense.</p>

<p>To be able to go through periods of feeling naked and unsure.</p>

<p>In zen they call it having ‚Äúno roof over head, no ground under foot‚Äù.</p>

<p>Because the prerequisite for clarity is confusion. The greatest insights must come from equally great ignorance.</p>

<p>But you gotta be willing to discard your own beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to get strong, you first need the humility of being weak.</p>

  <p>To get what you want you have to deserve what you want.</p>

  <p>The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.</p>

  <p><cite>Charlie Munger</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freedom is not free and the price for comfort is discomfort.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the ultimate marshmallow test:</p>

<p>Either be safe now and face uncertainty later. Or, embrace uncertainty for a more promising future.</p>

<p>Either way, uncertainty is coming for all of us.</p>

I"H<p>Hello.</p>

<p>I’m Gustaf.</p>

<p>Every morning I sit down and write for about an hour.</p>

<p>This website is the result.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The quick answer is…</p>

<ol>
  <li>Writing is fun</li>
  <li>It helps me think</li>
</ol>

<p>The complicated answer is that I can’t not write. That I begin to rot if I go more than one day without writing. Like as if my thoughts are tangling themselves into a big knot up there.</p>

<h2 id="errwho-are-you">Err…Who are you?</h2>
<p>Who am I? That’s a tough one.</p>

<p>I’m gonna have to come back for a more definite answer.</p>

<h2 id="whats-your-day-job">What’s your day job?</h2>
<p>I’m an indiehacker - which means I code stuff on the interwebs that generate income.</p>

<p>I’m also as an engineering student in my spare time, currently based in cold Stockholm.</p>

<p>Here’s me being a bit more professional: <a href="https://gustafbroman.github.io" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-been-your-greatest-realization-in-life">What’s been your greatest realization in life?</h2>
<p>That no one really knows what’s going on. We just vary in our ability to pretend we do. But really…no one does.</p>

<p>This has made me freer to try new things and more daring to ask stupid questions.</p>

<h2 id="okay-how-do-i-reach-out">Okay. How do I reach out?</h2>
<p>If you have any inquiries or propositions, you may reach out via the following email adress: contact@gustafdbroman.com</p>

<h2 id="what-wordpress-theme-is-this">What Wordpress theme is this?</h2>
<p>This website is not running on Wordpress. I createt my own <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> theme and deployed it for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Why? Because I’m a perfectionistic control freak who craves authority over every pixel and byte.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-writing-these-questions-to-yourself">Are you writing these questions to yourself?</h2>
<p>Maybe. No comment.</p>

<p>Shoot.</p>

<h2 id="moving-onwhat-do-you-write-about">Moving on…What do you write about?</h2>
<p>I’ve gradually come to realize that all of my goals can be traced back to two more grandiose ones.</p>

<p>A mission statement for life, if you will.</p>

<p>Namely, to</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand life</li>
  <li>Successfully operate within it by being useful</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="i-asked-what-you-write-about-not-your-freaking-mission-statement">I asked what you write about not your freaking mission statement</h2>
<p>But they’re the same! Don’t you see?</p>

<p>These two missions are what every article on here originate from.</p>

<h2 id="what-a-megalomaniac">What a megalomaniac!</h2>
<p>Although this is a personal website, it’s not about me. Or at least, that’s not my goal.</p>

<p>The aim here is to discuss ideas. Ideas which can possibly be helpful to all of us (that’s also a personal reminder to keep narcissism down at a healthy level).</p>

<p>So if some of this seems interesting to you, then I warmly welcome you to read the blog and join me on a journey of figuring out life.</p>

I"X<p>We can assign meaning. And it’s what we do.</p>

<p>Society, family, the economy.</p>

<p>“Because I was hungry.”</p>

<p>Our life’s purpose.</p>

<p>But is there anything beyond human interpretation? That of objectivity?</p>

<p>Not if you ask the existentialists.</p>

<p>It’s what they would call “the absurd”.</p>

<p>The absurdity lies in incompatibility.</p>

<p>Between that of human beings and the world they inhabit.</p>

<p>A human? Not absurd.</p>

<p>The universe? So what? Totally normal.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition between the two? Now, that’s absurd.</p>

<p>It’s comical, really.</p>

<p>On the one hand we have man, who craves meaning.</p>

<p>And on the other, a silent universe.</p>

<p>But who cares?</p>

<p>What’s so bad about conjuring up your own meaning?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it’s meaningful.</p>
